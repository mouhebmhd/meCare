    "### Scraping Health Board's Posts and Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on extracting posts and articles from Health Board forums using web scraping techniques. Health Board is a platform with a wealth of user-generated content on various health topics, making it an excellent resource for applications such as sentiment analysis, trend monitoring, and topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Retrieve posts and articles from specific health-related categories on Health Board based on topic criteria (e.g., mental health, fitness).\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.\n",
    "- **Data Storage**: Store the scraped data in a structured format, such as CSV or a database, for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools and Technologies\n",
    "- **Python**: The primary programming language for web scraping.\n",
    "- **Beautiful Soup**: A library for parsing HTML and extracting data.\n",
    "- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests to access web pages.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: A data manipulation library to handle and analyze the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "1. **Set Up the Environment**: Install the necessary libraries using pip.\n",
    "2. **Define Scraping Logic**: Write functions to scrape data from specific health categories on Health Board.\n",
    "3. **Run the Scraper**: Execute the scraping script and monitor the data collection process.\n",
    "4. **Analyze the Data**: Use Pandas to analyze the collected posts and articles for insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "This project serves as a practical introduction to web scraping and data analysis using Python, providing valuable experience in handling real-world data from an online health community.\n"

      "had half of thyroid out 19 years ago, multinodular goiter. have antibodies for hashimotos quit smoking in Feb, now my thyroid went the other way, TSH is .01, and FT3 is elevated. I believe my multinodular goiter is now toxic. seeing endo next week and ENT next month. i'm concerned because my heartbeat is very noticeable after i go up 3 flights of stairs. i have extreme fatigue. I hope I will be ok in the meantime until we get this sorted out\n",
      "I am posting this question for my husband. 2 Yrs ago, he had a bad accident at work where he almost lost his leg. 9 \"Leg salvage\" surgeries where a muscle &amp; artery was taken from upper thigh &amp; sewn in lower leg, tibia nail, screws, skin flap, bone graft, he now has drop foot and our biggest fear is his coming down with Diabetes with his LEG LIKE THIS. It's basically a \"Frankenstein\" leg now. He recently had Blood work (will see Doc in 2 weeks) his TSH was 7.740 - this is Subclinical Hypothyroidism as I have been reading, he wants him to start on the 25mcg of Levothyroxine. I've been reading how taking these meds RAISES BLOOD SUGAR, his Sugar is always around 107 -115 when getting blood tests, so he is teetering towards Type 2. Thankfully his health was good enough when he had the accident, his leg healed without problems... Anyone here who got Type 2 after starting Thyroid Meds. Should we be worried , is there anyway to fix this would out starting the Thyroid Hormone, as once you start, there is no going back, right? Its possible his iodine level may be lower as I don't cook with much salt... not sure he was tested for Iodine. We try to limit that so his blood pressure won't go up.. If you do one thing, it causes problems with another!! Getting older sucks. He is 60 yrs old, he is not overweight, but a thin man approx 155 lbs/ 5'9 . Thank you\n",
      "33F/Utah Help Understanding Test Reults I am a 33F from UT that has been experiencing severe fatigue, bad joint and muscle pain and just overall feeling crappy. 5 feet 5 in 180lbs I am on Lexapro, Procare Vitamin with 45mg iron, Blood pressure meds only major surgery was a gastric bypass. I have had iron anemia since I was a teen. My doctor(GP) and endocrinologist have run several tests to try to figure out whats going on but they seem to disagree with each other. My primary doctor thinks that it's secondary hyperparathyroidism due to calcium deficiency but the endocrinologist thinks it's primary so they ran a bunch of additional blood work to try to determine it but the results are very confusing to me because they're conflicting what they said they were looking for. Can anyone help interpet these ? Calcium, Ionized 1.17 Albumin 4.3 Sodium 135 Potassium 4.2 CO2 21 Calcium 9.0 Phosphorus 4.2 Iron 169 Iron Saturation 54 TBIC 315 RBC 5.06 RDW 12.2 Lymphocytes Absolute 3.31 24 HR URINE CALCIUM 293 I'm trying to understand what all these mean and my GP originally prescribed calcium citrate twice a day but it was making my symptoms worse and my fatigue was really bad so he had me stop to run more tests. I was only on it for 3 days. My GP said primary and secondary are treated differently so they have to determine which one before I move forward but I'm in a lot of pain that's just getting worse.\n",
      "I had been taking levothyroxine 0.88 mg at a stable dose for over a year, but on May 30, my TSH jumped up to 10.99. My doctor then increased my dose to 1.12 mg. I just had labs done on Thursday, and now my TSH is 13.16! My T3 is 96 ng/dl and my free T4 is 0.77 ng/dl. How can TSH be so high while T3 and T4 are in the normal range? How is it possible that I need another dosage increase so soon? I do have a subclinical Epstein-Barr infection, but I am taking turmeric to manage inflammation. I have been very tired and have been gaining weight.\n",
      "Has anyone experienced an elevated paraythyroid level while receiving prolia injection at six-month intervals. I started prolia this year in January with a normal PTH level - now it is showing at 169 on recent blood work.

      "My mother is a 58-year-old Pakistani woman who underwent full thyroid removal surgery in 2021. Following the procedure, she began experiencing a burning sensation in her body, particularly in her feet and head. Additionally, she has been dealing with digestive problems and skin allergies called Urticaria since 2019. While she has been managing her skin allergies through medication and avoiding certain foods, the burning sensation has become increasingly painful since the surgery. As a result, she has been struggling with depression and difficulty sleeping due to her health issues. Despite seeing numerous doctors and trying various medications, she has found little relief. She has also noticed that some medications exacerbate the burning sensation. On days when her skin allergies are severe, she feels less or no burning sensation, but the allergies make her daily life more challenging. Conversely, on days when the burning sensation is more intense, especially in her head, she has fewer or no allergies. Recently, her burning sensation has become even more severe, to the point where it causes her to cry. The medication that used to alleviate her symptoms is no longer effective. She describes the burning sensation as feeling like \"strong acid running through my entire body, especially in my head.\" We are seeking your medical advice and treatment recommendations for her condition. Currently, she is taking the following medications: For stomach: Bifasic 60mg Cap (DEXLANSOPRAZOLE); Kiride (Levosulpiride 50mg/capsule) For sleep: Relaxin 3mg For Urticaria Skin Allergy: Tekostine (Ebastine) 10mg For thyroid: Thyroxine 50mcg For blood pressure: Exval-A (Amlodipine / Valsar: 5m/160m)\n",
      "I have all the symptoms of Hasimotos my brother has it my aunts, dad, and cousins. I have been feeling horrible, so I asked for them to do the testing for my annual. This is what it said T3-2.56, T4-1.05, and TSH-.80 these are lower than last year I am not sure what to make of this, but I am hoping for some guidance. I am tired of feeling this way.\n",
      "I have been living with Hashimotos Thyroiditis for almost 30 years. I have never lost weight while being treated and have steadily climbed to 232 lbs! There is no sign of anything else for me except the above. No cortisol issues or Addisons. Just fat. Assure from a dying metabolism- I also experience different reactions from the different medications and at the moment dont know what to do. Armour Naturthroid make me feel good except for hot spots of incessant itching. Cytomel with Levothyroxine swelling and water retention - hands and feet. Same for Tirosint. Any Synthroid other than to 50mcg make me itch. Is there anything else I can take or ask for to just feel good, stop the growth of my body, and not have to scratch parts of my skin off!\n",
      "Been dealing with this for over a year. My ferritin is low, my thyroid is low, but heres the fun: when I take iron for a while to raise my levels, one day Ill get a sudden rise in heartbeat from 77 to 170 within a minute. After I deal with that for a while, it calms down and then I get tremors for a half hour. Then I have to back off the iron or it happens again. Getting more tests soon, but has anyone else been through this? What did you do to solve it?\n",

      "Hello my name is Tesker, if you are reading this thank you for taking the time to listen to my life's story. This is going to be a long post because honestly at the moment I don't have anyone to talk to and I need to let it all out. Well I don't know where to start so I guess I'll just start with what happened about 5 hrs ago. Sadly the woman that I deeply love and have been loyal and in love with for 13 yrs, have two kids together and have been engaged for about a year now, stuck out her hand grabbed her engagement ring and told me that she can't do this anymore.....meaning us being together. I can't even describe to you the amount of sadness that I am feeling right now. I am so deeply in love with her but it's come to the point where I don't know who she is anymore. She used to be this sweet, loving, caring person that treated me with so much respect. We were unseperable. Before we became Bf and Gf I had to meet her 2 kids (Son 8yrs and daughter 2yrs. It wasent that long after where they both decided to call me dad. We were a happy family of four. About 2yrs together things started to get weird. My Gf started to get upset and irritable when me and my son would hang out together. We thought it was just jealousy but it started to get real violent. She would scream and yell at me just because me and my son would have fun together. She would get into these ridiculous rages. She realized that she would get upset for no reason and would be sorry. Being tired of feeling finally went to her doctor and eventually was told that she had hypothyroidism. Threw out eight years we had our meny moments of arguments. She would argue with me about everything. According to her she was never at fault. I honestly never liked to argue with her because it always turns out to be a three day argument. From the research that I learned about hypo I new that she wasent her self and COULDENT be upset with her. But some arguments were so obviously all in her head that I couldent help myself from not losing my cool which made things worse. We broke up around 4 times all over pointless things. But things got a whole lot worse about 5 yrs back when our oldest son was shot and killed at work. It devastated all of us but especially her. Because of that she got in a state of depression that she developed Broken heart Syndrome which caused her to now suffer with Chronic Heart Failure. She now has a hard time catching her breath. Did I mention she also suffers from sleep apnea. Yes at night as she sleeps she sometimes stops breathing. With her constant mood swings, her depression over the loss of my son, dealing with her chronic heart failure she isent the same person anymore. All she does is argue with me about anything. Why I came home late from work. Why I left the mess in the kitchen, I mean she still argues with me about me supposably losing the house keys three yrs ago when there was no proof. I have been slowly losing the girl that I fell in love with due to hypothyroidism. This last argument that we just had had to be the worst one out of them all. While I was asleep I was dreaming that she had died. I saw both of my kids weeping and shouting for their mom to wake up. I was holding her yelling for her to wake up. I eventually woke my self up screaming babe and when I saw her laying there with her eyes closed I started crying. She quickly woke up and I cried even deeper happy that she was alive. I never cried the way I cried at that moment. What started the argument was that at the time in my worst after I told her what I have just dreamed she without any kind of sympathy or compaction just told me \" It's just a dream\" and effortlessly put her one arm around me and repeated \"I'm here it's just a dream\" and then went back to sleep. I was so hurt and upset that I got up and went to the restroom. I could not stop crying . Uncontrollable crying. Then when I got out of the bathroom she was now awake and as I sat next to her all she was talking about was about mail that was sent to us by mistake. I felt so hurt that she still did not show me any kind of comfort especially because it was about losing her something that I worry about all the time. I mentioned to her that I felt that she was rude and inconsiderate towards my feelings and she went off on me. She was so offended that she put out her hand and grabbed her ring and said to me \" I can't do this anymore \" ant took off her engagement ring and gave it back to me . It feels like the end. I feel hopeless in everything that I try to do for her. I always keep in mind that she has medical issues and I shouldn't blame her for anything. She doesn't want to talk. She doesn't want to ever discuss her condition. Just always wants to argue. Well that was my story. Thanks for those who took the time to read it. I'm not sure what I am going to do but I'm am just going to pray to God and hope for the best.\n",
      "Hello! I have been on a very low sodium diet (< than 1000 mgs a day) for about 8 years due to meniere's disease. I don't add salt to my food at all and omit salt from my baking. In addition I eat very little dairy food and/or sea food, both of which are major sources of iodine. I eat very little processed food. I never knew there was a connection between low sodium diets and hypothyroidism until I started googling for reasons as to why I have lost so much hair in the last couple of years, then I find low sodium diets can cause iodine deficiency which in turn can cause hypothyroidism. My TSH level is checked every year at my annual physical and is always \"normal.\" It has been going up steadily though and in April it was 2.2. Last time the Free T4 was checked was in 2012 and at that time it was .79. Because these are \"normal\" my doctor won't do any more testing. In addition to the hair loss I have several symptoms - high total cholesterol and LDL (trigs and HDL are excellent) despite eating ALL of the right food, none of the wrong and walking daily, exhaustion/fatigue, slowness of movement, depression, cramping in legs and feet, constipation, no motivation to do anything, can't concentrate. Strangely I have 1 symptom usually attributed to hyperthyroidism - terrible insomnia (no problem falling asleep but wake several times in the night), I probably average 3-6 hours of sleep at best. Also I am not obese and actually have lost a bit of weight lately as I gave up my daily muffin and granola, hoping to bring my cholesterol down (brought it down a whopping two points!) Anyone have any experience with iodine deficiency and hypo? Does it sound like I could have hypo? With my doctor unwilling to do any further testing I'm not sure what to do - just live with it and accept that I'm getting older as he tells me to do? I'm 63 and other than this and celiac I'm in pretty darn good health, but it's starting to make me feel very old. I know I could add more iodine to my diet to see how it makes me feel but before I do that I really would like to know for sure if this is my problem.\n",
      "32 Hi all Haven't been on here in a very long time. I had my thyroid removed many many years ago. I have been on Levothyroxine. 'But, am not sure what time to take it. You can't have calcium or iron within 4 hours of taking the Levothyroxine. I've been taking at about 3 or 4 in the morning. Many many times I can't fall back asleep. I sleep only like 1 1/2 hours at a time. If I were to take it when I get up at about 6:30 am then I wouldn't be able to eat till about 10:30. I can't eat my cereal with water, etc. I need some advice. Thanks\n",
      "I will be getting all the tests tomorrow but this one confuses me. I have been treated for hypo (Levothyroxine 137mg daily) But lately, my heart rate is much higher (99-120) palpitations constantly, and extreme exhaustion. My sleep used to be fantastic and now I'm getting about half of what I used to. Lost 7 pounds without trying. Is this hyper now? Do I need less Levothyroxine?\n",
      "Wow long time since I've been here! TT in 2006, could never tolerate any amount of T3, survived on levoxyl until menopause hit. Now, mysteriously, I can take Armour to a certain point. I'm on 2 grains (120 mgs) and very tired. I recently took 135 mgs of armour for 2 months, and I got very anxious/depressed and my hair started falling out. My labs showed low free t4, low free t3 and, of course, no TSH. I increased to 150 mg and in a week I was almost hospitalized with hyper symptoms. Never again. When I reduced to 120 mg those symptoms subsided and I even lost a little weight - go figure. But I get so tired that I'm afraid I'm going to pass out behind the wheel. Today I started on a combination of 120 mg (2 grains) Armour and 25 mcg Levoxyl - anybody else combining like this? I'm hoping it works as I can't seem to tolerate any more T3. Cheers!\n",
      "I have hashi's and have been on levothyroxine for several years and after speaking with others about the importance of antibodies got tested and even though not extremely elevated, the antibodies are elevated. I am waiting to switch over to Armour but am waiting for the Doctor to call. In the meantime, I have shortness of breath that is constant with chest tightness. I was diagnosed with mild persistent asthma last year but the albuterol and qvar are no longer helping. I have read where others have had shortness of breath but only with exercise.

      "Hello! I recently received test results for my thyroid which indicated that I was extremely hypothyroid and had Hashimoto's. TSH was crazy high at 26; Free T4 was low at .47; Reverse T3 was low at 6.8 and TPO was off the charts at greater than 600. I don't have a General Practitioner. These results were from a blood test issued by my GYN and a blood test issued by a functional medicine doctor. My GYN put me on 100mg Levothyroxine. I have been on it for a week. My weight gain has been 45+ lbs over the past year.. and it is still climbing (even tho I exercise daily; eat whole unprocessed foods; have been dairy free; sugar free..). It is so frustrating. I am not sure low long it takes for Levothyroxine to start working.. and I know I won't immediately lose weight, but, I am wondering: Should I go see an endocrinologist? Should I be on other medication or homeopathic options (functional medicine doctor recommended several)? Is there something else I should do? I have gone through menopause.. never had hot flashes, sleep issues, etc. Getting frustrated with this continual weight gain.. Thanks for any feedback!\n",

I was recently (in Aug) diagnosed with Afib, and informed that my heart is beating a little to fast than it should be. I have been place on medication for both. My endocrinologist office told me to stop taking my Methimazole 10mgs at the end of Aug 2021. Next appt I could get with my endocrinologist was at the end of Sept 2021. I do email him/the office, through their portal. I have never been seen in person, due to COVID, so using the email has been a normal way to communicate with the office, and has worked, expect lately. Since I have gone off the thyroid medication I really haven't been able to get any help. His latest email just said \"you have Graves' hyperthyroidism, and have been taking methimazole.\" Well I know that because his office diagnosed me with that in March of 2021 and placed me on the methimazole then.

      "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism back in August 2020, and started with Synthroid (Levothyroxine) 25mg. Within 1 week I start having heart palpitation and the doctor said unless my heart rate is over 100, there's nothing to worry about, which according to my fitness tracker, it was not over 100. By November, I've had enough of the constant heart palpitation, especially at night, that I asked my doctor to reduce my dose to half (I cut the pill to half), and the palpitation seem to tone down a lot, though still happen sometimes. Here's the list of my lab result: TSH 3rd Generation (normal 0.45-5.33) 8/27/2020 10.08 (diagnosed with hypo, started with 25mg) 10/5/2020 2.55 11/30/2020 1.34 (complained about heart palpitation during visit, dr reduced to half dose, cutting 25mg in half, once a day) 12/31/2020 2.26 2/19/2021 7.27 (dr asked me to go back to full 25mg dose) 4/30/2021 3.85 so after I went back to full 25mg dose, the heart palpitation started again and getting worse, just this past week I kept waking up middle of night with pounding heart beat (rate around 80-90), and once I woke up I started sweating. during the day if I'm sitting still or not moving, I can count my heart beat without checking the pulse, worse during the night, after meal, and when I wake up. I'm having hard time falling asleep, and staying sleep, because I can feel the heart beat in my upper body. I'm scheduling a visit with my doctor again, but want to know if anyone has similar experience and what's your solution/remedy. What are other alternative? that I can bring to my doctor to discuss?

      "This year my thryroid ultrasound shows a \"partially calcified 6 x 6 x 5 mm very hypoechoic solid nodule with punctate internal echogenicities that were not evident previously\" (lab report wording). I have been getting thyroid ultrasounds every year since 2015 when the first nodules were found, but they have never gotten any larger & actually many were smaller. Labs done this year show TSH at 0.015 (range 0.465 - 4.680 uTU/mL) with Free T3 & T4 levels normal (above midrange). Last year my TSH was 1.15 & my T3 & T4 were a bit lower but still around midrange, so there is a significant difference this year. Yet my doctor doesn't seem concerned & just says to wait & do another ultrasound in a year.

      "Hello. I am a 47-year-old male, and I have autoimmune hypothyroidism. I recently heard that something called \"low-level laser therapy\" or \"cold-laser therapy\" can be used on a thyroid gland that has been damaged by Hashimoto's. Supposedly, the laser therapy will regenerate the thyroid gland, restore the ability of the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormone, and significantly reduce (or even eliminate entirely) a person's need for Synthroid. Has anyone on this forum received low-level laser therapy on the thyroid gland? Also, I have heard that some people buy these lasers online and proceed to apply this laser therapy onto their own thyroid glands (like a do-it-yourself project). Has anyone on this forum tried to use such a laser on his/her own thyroid? Any information would be appreciated. Thank you.\n",

I have an active 11 yr old 5ft 146lbs presenting with chest pain at random times not constant and not always during activity but happens multiple times a week, normal awake resting PR is on average 100bpm at its lowest and asleep PR average is high 80s to 90s. She is often super tired throughout the day but still makes her self stay active. She has been to a cardiologist that shows 12lead and all labs at the time appear to be within normal ranges. She has close family history of Hashimotos, maternal grandmother but she was only diagnosed a few yrs ago, and as a toddler had a low functioning thyroid that went into normal levels prior to needing medications. She started menstruation at 9, was also weighed 1 month prior and has gained 10lbs and in the last yr or so has gained around 60lb. Md wants to send her back to cardio even tho i never asked for cardio i asked for endo in the first place. But if i take her without referral i have to have a legitimate reason for insurance other then I'm an EMT and have a gut feeling. So should i go straight to endo to have them run the antibody test for Hashimotos or wait the 2 wks to get into cardio for them to say the same thing and then have to wait even longer to get her into endo.

Not sure if that matters or not. Should I get another test from somewhere else? I don't have insurance so it comes completely out of pocket and I am on a tight budget. Was hoping my doctor could give me more information when I went to her, but I don't feel like she took me seriously enough to run the complete panel. There has to be an explanation as to why I'm feeling the way I do. If it's not my thyroid, I have no idea what could be going on.\n",
      "Hello, Can anyone tell me what some safe and natural alternatives to Synthroid are?\n",
      "I feel like a sitting choking duck in a very rural area. 49 yr old female. This all started with pfhlem. I noticed alot of it and always having to hock it out. Then I started waking up at night choking on it. Within a couple of weeks, it progressed to actual shooting pain in the lower neck area, a swelled neck feeling, severe difficulty in swallowing (cant even swallow tiny pills) and the 'something stuck in my throat' feeling, headaches and lots of burping/gas.. I have had very little, broken sleep the past 7 weeks. Everything is even worse when I lay down. I call my doctor, have a video appt. Due to the pandemic. She said go to the ER. I travel the one hour to the ER at our small hospital (I live in a VERY rural area, health care is not all that great and very few specialists to speak of). With this pandemic going on, this is especially nerve racking and extremely scary. They did an iv and gave me anxiety med through it because I was hysterical. They did an MRI which showed nothing stuck in my throat, gave me some acid reflux meds, an anxiety med and referred me to a general surgeon for follow up. By the time I got into seeing the GS, my anxiety and panic attacks are full force. I literally felt on that day I was dying from being choked. He was annoyed with me. Did not really want to talk to me much and orders upper GI and throat scope and walks out of the room. Results are there is a small amount of acid reflux. There are also 3 stomach ulcers which may explain the need to burp all the time. He puts me on a PPI and sucralfate and not to take aspirin or any other Nsaids. Of course this does nothing for the choking feeling, and seems to help only mildly on the burping. He then ordered a chest xray (came back ok) and a thyroid ultrasound. The ultrasound showed no nodules but the results said inflamed. I then got bloodwork done. Those results came back as normal I just couldn't believe it. Here are the numbers: TSH 0.6630 uIU/mL (^^ this number was 1.6234 5 months ago) Free Thyroxine 1.08 ng/dL Thyroperoxidase Antibody 25 IU/mL Thyroglobulin Antibody < 20 IU/ml Reverse Triiodothyronine 14.2 ng/dl I was diagnosed three years ago with subclerical hyperthyroid. At the time, I didnt pay much attention to it. Nothing bothered me. This was diagnosed where I used to live, which is 3 hours away. I called them, they refused referral because they said the numbers where normal. I've been set up with an Endo via video in a few weeks, but not sure if I'll even make it that long without choking out and absolutely no specialist within 3 hours of me that seems to know anything about thyroid or what may be going on here. The Endo I have a video scheduled with isnt even in my state and I am having to wait 3 1/2 weeks and travel to the little hospital to even do a video call ! 😭 I got a two day break from this...praying it would not return...but now all of it is back, full force. I can't eat, can't sleep, can't concentrate. Noises irrite me. I get sore throats. My hands are shaky. The swelled choking and full of mucus in my throat is horrifically terryifying. I often have a headache. I have water next to the bed and sip it all night long. My anxiety is out of control. When the flare is real bad, I cradle myself and pull my hair and dont realize it until my husband stops me, this is how ridiculous this is. Just my husband walking past the couch sends me through the roof.This feels like an imminent threat to my 'being' and is destroying my life and nobody seems to think any of it is a big deal while I feel like I am choking and going A wall. I am going back, again, to my regular doctor today. I dont know what to say other than everything I've already told them. Does anybody, anywhere have any suggestions or insight about this at all 😭😭. Thank you so very much for any advice at all\n",
      "Hi, I did one of those mail in tests after experiencing some symptoms (unexplained weight gain etc) and these were the results - T4 - 87 nmol/L (normal) TSH - 2.87 mlU/L (normal) FT4 - 14.6 pmol/l (normal) T3 - 4.6 pmol/L (normal) TPO - < 9.0 IU/ml (normal) TGAB - 298 IU/mL (high - range should be between 0 and 115) Cortisol - 19.8 ug/dL (high - range should be between 6 and 8.4) Any insight on this? I am seeing a doctor tomorrow and want to know what type of questions to ask, what tests to push for. Any idea of what those levels might indicate?\n",
      "Hello! Without boring you guys to tears, I'm dealing with some symptoms(random leg hair loss, sudden weight gain, brain fog, constipation, dry skin, vision changes, fatigue, etc) and I recently had blood work done. Some results I took note of: Ldl chol calc: 117 (high) Free Thyroxine Index 1.4 T3 uptake: 26 Thyroxine T4: 5.5 TSH: 2.65 After doing much research, it lines up with a lot of the hypothyroidism symptoms I read about.

      "For 9 years, I took 1 grain/65 mg Naturthroid and felt good Went through menopause a couple years ago Suddenly in Dec 2019, I went hyper (main symptoms were mini anxiety surges and heart skipping beats; confirmed by blood test) Dumped my old GP (who was pretty new to me) who didn't know what to do or how to listen Found naturopath who tested several different thyroid meds (including synthetic)...all made me hyper Stopped taking thyroid and 6 weeks later was most hypo I'd ever been (TSH was 17 and felt crappy) Started taking Naturthroid 1/4 gr/15 mg and 6 weeks later had TSH of 8 and felt a lot better, but could be better Naturthroid recalled for having decreased efficacy Started alternating remaining 1/4 gr/15 mg Naturthroid and 1/4 gr/15 mg Armour with intent to fully transition to Armour Within 3 days was having same hyper symptoms that I had back in December Both my dr and I are totally stumped. 1/4 gr/15 mg Naturthroid almost gets me where I need to be, but I still needed more. 1/4 gr/15 mg Armour makes me hyper. Now Naturthroid isn't available. The only thing we can come up with is that I had been pretty sick with a virus (early Covid???) in Nov...it was a couple weeks later that my thyroid wacked out. At this point, I'm thinking of taking 1/4 gr/15 mg Armour every other day and see where that gets me. Anyone have any info I can give my doctor to help us figure this out?\n",
      "I was diagnosed 6 days ago and put on Levo 25 mcg/day. Any suggestions on how to cope with fatigue and weight gain. I walk daily at least 2 miles even before diagnosis. Should I add any supplements?\n",
      "I desperately looking for answers of why I feel so horrible. Short back story... I was diagnosed borderline hoshimoto' s disease when I was 10 and was put on synthroid when I was 21. I have had 3 successful pregnancies with this disease and consider myself lucky. Since my last pregnancy 3 years ago my thyroid keeps bouncing from over medicated to undereducated. Recently I was at my endocrinologist complaining of hyper symptoms but my THE showed 1.92. So she told.me I was normal and sent me on my way. I last 7 days until I couldn't take the racing heart, shortness of breath and basically wanting to jump out of my skin and I went to the emergency room. They did a thyroid panel and it showed my TSH .243 and my t4 and free t4 were out of range. My doctor did a slight med change that did not give me any relief. I kept calling and begging for her to lower my synthroid dose that was 200mcg every day but Sunday I would take 100 mcg. She would have her nurse call me that couldn't answer my questions and told me to just not take a pill Sunday. I couldn't function taking care of my kids with the severe anxiety and panic attacks. Unfortunately, I was desperate and lowered my dose to 150mcg on my own telling myself I would rather have hypo symptoms than hyper. I found a new doctor who I don't love but I'm stuck with now. He kept me at 150mcg telling me I made a significant decrease but if I felt better than it was ok. Low and behold 3 weeks later on the new dose I am having extreme fatigue, muscle weakness and tingling in my hands. My most annoying symptom right now is that certain spots of my face feel numb and tingly. It comes and goes and is always on different sides. After this long tale.of woe, I am wondering if I should call my new doctor tomorrow and ask for a med change or hang on till my appt in 3 weeks to get a good reading on my levels. It's the facial tingling that's flipping me out. It started last week. If anyone has a similar situation it would help put my mind at ease. It's difficult with the 3 kids to feel like this.\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "I was originally diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism about 4-5 years ago, and have for the most part been stable with a tsh between 1.5 and 2 (It spiked a bit last year nearing 4.2, but it was also not long after moving and being super stressed out, which probably didn't help). I've stayed on the starting dose of 25 mcg, with the exception of a couple months that I tried armour thyroid before switching back due to insurance issues. I've been thinking about trying CBD oil for my Panic Disorder (I'm less worried now that recreational marijuana is now legal in IL; I know the two aren't connected per say, but I'm a worry wart), but I don't want it to negatively affect my thyroid. Do any of y'all have experience in using CBD while being hypothyroid?\n",

      "Hey there, Im hoping to get some guidance and advice because Ive been frustrated with my Levothyroxine dose for a few years now. Some background: im a 37 y/o female and was diagnosed with papillary/follicular variant thyroid cancer at 25. I had a total thyroidectomy and a few rounds of iodine treatments. Since then, Ive been cancer free. I started on Levo and was at 175mcg at the beginning, and Ive slowly gone down to 137mcg. My doctor had me switch to 137 because he said my bloodwork warranted the results, but I told him that about 6-8 weeks after the switch, I started to gain weight a lot easier, needed 9-10 hours of sleep a night, and my hair started to thin out. I also got cold a lot easier and my fingers and toes were always freezing in the winter, and I just felt off. He tested me again to make sure and said my bloodwork still warranted the 137 dosage. So for the last two years or so, Ive just lived with it. I started to get really serious about my weight (I was probably 20lbs overweight before my dose was switched to 137) and since my last appt a year ago, I lost 12 lbs. I know its not a lot, but I really watch what I eat and workout like crazy, and its still so hard to lose weight. Just the other day at my yearly Endo appt, he said my labs indicated a lower dose to 128mcg (not exactly sure, but it was 120-something). I asked why and he said I was overstimulated more than needed, even for a cancer patient, and since I had lost weight, that probably prompted the change in my labs. I took a look at my labs (honestly, for the first time in years) and he only tested me for Thyroglobulin and Thyroglobulin antibodies. No TSH or anything else. Im the kind of person who usually just does whatever the doctor says because Im sure its hard for them for everyone to come in and say well, I read this online ... after they went through years of medical school. But Im actually terrified to go on this lower dose when I feel like im already struggling with my current one. And I reiterated my symptoms to him at my most recent visit. I was more or less told that labs dont lie and if I continue to lose weight, I should feel better. Should I ask to be tested for the standard thyroid panels? Even if Im a cancer thyroid patient, is it standard to only test for Thyroglobulin? Is questioning him warranted? I would just love any advice from those more experienced than myself. Thank you so much.\n",
      "I am extremely sensitive to changes in my TSH. When I go hypo I become severely depressed and anxious. Right now I am over-medicated. My TSH is .071 and I have felt irritable and anxious all week and it scares me that my depression is coming back. We are decreasing my Synthroid and recheck in 6 weeks. My questions are: do other thyroid sufferers deal with mood disorders AND do you consider my TSH to be hyper? My free T4 was normal. Please let me hear from my fellow mood disorder sufferers😄!!!\n",
      "Hello, I had my thyroid ablated and then placed on synthroid. I was placed on it fairly quickly post ablation, they waited till my TSH showed I was hypothyroid. I only gained 4 lbs so basically not much weight gain post ablation. I've always been very active and normal BMI. I continue to walk, play tennis and do light weight lifting throughout the week. I am irritated because, as soon as I started taking synthroid, I developed a lot of cellulite on the front of my thighs and arms. The doctors say it's because of hypothyroidism but my TSH is normal and I am a fit person. Why is no one acknowledging that synthroid causes this??? I read several bloggers on this matter, on this site c/o the same thing so I know I am not out of my mind on this matter. I am hoping to get some comments from others with this issue too.

      "Hello, My son (13) has had pretty much all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism for the past few years. His quality of life stinks. Doctors have even tried psychotropic medications for his depression and fatigue symptoms a few years ago, but they did not help. His last year of blood tests, his TSH levels were as follows: 3.3, 5.8, 8.5, and 4.2. Doctor said he would think about treating when he saw 8.5 and had us make an appointment. But then he ordered more tests at appointment and now numbers look low again at 4.2. Is it normal for TSH to fluctuate like this? We have tried various things to figure out what is going on, but all of his symptoms always lead my search back to hypothyroidism. Does anyone think this is possible with these blood results that he could in fact have hypothyroidism? Thank you.\n",
      "I really hope some one can shed some light on to my inquiry. I will try to be brief. For the most part for as long as I have known my wife (8 years) she has had these characteristics (I will elaborate below) and its been off and on how much these things bother me. Well its gotten to a point were I cant wait anymore and I am beginning to think there is a medical origin to most if not all what I am about to say. Here are some \"symptoms\" I think she has that I have cross referenced online with a possible thyroid condition. - She generally lacks energy and stamina. (Our running joke is that I have 6 batteries while she has two.) She NEEDS a nap during the day even on a good nights rest. She has always been this way. In grade school her mother would warn teachers that she will probably fall asleep during class. The duration of her sleep has always been fairly short compared to me 6-7 hours maybe. - She almost has no sex drive. (might have to do with the energy thing but possibly hormonal). - She is quick to anger and slow to calm down. One moment we can be reminiscing of a romantic memory (and all is well in the world) then I do \"something\" to anger the beast and suddenly I am enemy number one, and there is no talking her down or reasoning with her. She is just ANGRY. She has even admitted she has issues with anger. - She gets these muscle cramps in both her calf muscles. She has described it like restless leg syndrome. She gets these regardless of physical activity pretty much daily. - She has dealt with bad depression in the past but even today dealing with family issues can put her in a slump for days on end. - Her hair has been on the course and thin side (notably more so than the average women) - Lets even through in intolerance to cold (however she is Chinese and they hate the cold, but worth mentioning). One more caveat: We had a baby a year ago (she was like this before the baby) and doctors did checks on her blood/hormone levels while she was pregnant. Everything checked out then. Would pregnancy throw thyroid hormones out of wack or do they not even check that on pregnant women. Or is this low testosterone .... uhhh I don't know, very frustrating. I know no one can say for sure without blood work but can someone give me their opinion on this. Give us a reason to get blood work done. Thanks! (BTW we live and work in China so bear that in mind when giving advice of medical treatment).\n",

While googling all the scary terms on the report, I googled this one too, and it sounds scarier than all the neck stuff that's listed, especially when I saw 5% are cancerous and that means 1 in 20, and half an inch is pretty big for something as small as a thyroid. I have an appointment in two weeks with my PCP. Should I call every day for an opening earlier? Should I be comforted that I have no signs of hyperthyroidism?

      "Hi everyone. I had a thyroid ablation in 2011 and have been teeter tottering with my tsh ever since. The highest dose of synthroid that I have been on is 94mcg a day. My tsh was 5.60 back in December of 2018 when I was on a dosage of 100/75 alternating daily. Then I increased the dosage to 100/100/75 and my tsh went to 3.41 so i continued to increase to 100/100/100/75 then starting over on that routine hoping to keep lowering my tsh. It finally went down to 2.41(.30-4.20) normal range. At that point I started getting diarreah about 7 times a day running low grade fevers got tremors and extreme muscle weakness and shooting pains. Felt like I have had the flu for the past 9 months. I then backed off of my synthroid to 87 mcg a day and the tremors went fevers stopped and diarreah stopped. But Im so exhausted and my muscles ache and my joints hurt to even move them. I got my thyroid checked a weak ago and the tsh is 6.70(.30-4.20) free t4 .90. (.70-1.90) total t4 8.7 free t3 2.6.

      "Hello! I'm new to this and need some advice/help/guidance. I'm 25 female. My sister and my mom both have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism so my doctor has been watching my thyroid to see if I end up having the same. Well three weeks ago my blood work for TSH was 0.04. Which is not what I was expecting. My endocrinologist appointment isn't until the end of November. It's a bit shocking that I could have hyperthyroidism. I'm easily fatigued, mood swings, heat intolerance, stomach issues, and big-time weight problems. Here's the thing since I've been easily tired I thought it was just stressed from work and other symptoms started I just thought it was caused by my weight. I'm struggling big time with my weight, unlike the common symptom of weight loss, it's really easy for me to gain weight. My activity levels and eating habits since (I would say symptoms started in February) haven't really changed that drastically. I also have the strangest dreams and suffered from night terrors. I'm a little worried that because I'm having these problems something is seriously wrong. Anyone else have these problems with hyperthyroidism? Keep in mind I haven't seen a specialist yet.\n",

      "Hi Everyone, I joined these message boards because I am seeking advice and guidance about what I think is a hypothyroidism issue. I have *ridiculous* symptoms. As in: I'm always cold, I gained ~60 pounds over the course of a year without changing anything. Dieted/fasted and nada. nothing. zip. I lose a pound, I gain a pound. My skin bruises easily, my nails are so brittle they snap off and flake, with ridges, my hair is thinning so much you can see my scalp I have ligament laxity and have injured myself to the point of needing 3 ligament repairs I have deQuervain's tenosynovitis, plantar fasciitis, a torn hip flexor... Vertigo, tinnitus, extreme fatigue, insomnia Family history of thyroid disease. I've cut out gluten, raw goitrogens, all soy, dairy, nightshades. So the \"doctors\" test me for hypothyroidism and every time they say it's normal and they tell me to \"eat less move more\" (until my last ligament surgery, I was exercising 8 hours a week min). Here are my numbers for the only 2 tests the stingy health\"care\" provider have been willing to get me: TSH - 3.43 uIU/ml, free T4 - 0.94 ng/dL. And they are within the range provided so he does nothing, other than to tell me again to eat less and move more. So I did some research about acceptable ranges, and possibly the TSH is not normal? I sent the \"doctor\" with my research, my pitch for a full thyroid panel (TSH, T4, free T4, T3, free T3, T3 uptake, reverse T3, TPO Ab, Tg Ab) and all he is willing to do is TPO Ab (I have a fairly recent TSH and free T4 so that's all good, but none of the others), which I guess is a minor win. Do you guys think I should push back and try to get the additional tests? What could fall through the cracks if I don't get the other tests done? What are you guys' thoughts on the existing test #s, specifically the TSH? Thanks in advance\n",
      "Hi everyone I have zero idea what Im dealing with here. Neither does my doc. Was dc with Hashimotos 3 years ago - have always had high antibodies. My Thyroglobulin was just tested and was very high, (NOT the antibodies - those were also high but Im talking about just the Thyroglobulin). Doc doesnt know what this means. Endo basically doesnt care. I had an ultrasound two years ago and it showed a small thyroid with heterogeneous features and no nodules. Does this Thyroglobulin mean anything? Could it signify cancer given normal-ish ultrasound? Please help?\n",
      "My Granddaughter is 22 and just had blood work done for her thyroid. Her symptoms are, cannot lose weight, extreme fatigue, depression very dry skin. Her results came back and she's with in normal ranges. I know you can be within normal ranges, but be close to being outside the normal ranges, whether high or low thyroid levels. The range on her test is as follows: .4 to 4.5 Her result was .96 does someone know how to interpret this as to whether she could be close to being out of range as too hyper or hypo? Thank you so much.\n",
      "Hi, I don't know if anyone can help me? I was told I have a thyroid nodule and it is now 10mm. I am supposed to go back in 6 months times as the doctor said they need to monitor the nodule, but I was surprised at the lack of information or urgency. I am left feeling worried as they didn't offer to take a biopsy. Would they know if it was cancerous from the ultra sound? The next time I go back should I insist on a biopsy? I was also reading about radiotherapy to decrease the size of the nodule, does anyone know what is the best treatment for nodules. Thank you! 🙂\n",
      "Hey guys. Sorry, not sure if this is the best group. Wanted to ask the group about some weirdness my body has been through. I am including a bit of other info in case could be relevant. Sorry if post is a bit long. End of May 2019 I got hit with gastritis, duodenditis, and other GI inflammation suspected to be from nsaids, alcohol and major stress a had been enduring. Prior to this point, i felt completely normal, healthy, etc Confirmed gastritis with colonoscopy/endoscopy on June 24, 2019. Gi doc gave medications to help heal (carafate and took pepcid). All biopsies were negative for anything sinister or could be a cause. Nsaids suspected to be related to cause. Throughout the month of June, while trying to manage gastritis and pain, diet, etc, i had lost 27lbs from eating so little and no appetite from the GI pain. Today i feel much better (mostly) and i'm eating a whole lot better now. Taking a step back, about last week of June, i had visited doc about some concerns (had some anxiety), he took a blood test and the only thing out of range was my vitamin D (at 19 ng/mL). Doc said this wasnt terribly low and said it should be quick to get back into range. Their lab testing ranges for Vitamin D are as follows: Deficiency : <20 ng/mL Insufficiency : 20-29 ng/mL Optimum Level : 30-80 ng/mL Possible Toxicity : >80 ng/mL Doctor prescribed Vit D2 (Ergocalciferol) 50000 iu weekly for 12 weeks. I've taken my 4th week dose this last Monday. I feel like I have been soooo dehydrated, dry mouth, tingles, and urinating a lot. I've been drinking so much water, but feels like goes right through me. I've also had decreased sweating, even outside in 90 degree heat. Been tired, cold, chills, etc I'm a bigger guy, and i normally sweat a lot. So this is completely unusual for me, even though i did end up losing just a bit over 30lbs altogether. I've recently found if i eat something really salty (ramen, etc) then drink more water, i feel like i retain fluids a bit normal, i can sweat again! Did some research and found that Ergocalciferol can contribute to increased urination, dehydration symptoms. Also in my searches, found there was some correlation between Vitamin D and Calcium levels. I looked at my past calcium blood labs. All previous labs had my calcium in the 9ish range, including early in June 2019 when i was first getting workup for what was determined to be my gastritis. My most recent calcium blood range from last week was 10.2, which is after i had been taking the Vitamin D2 supplement for 2-3 weeks or so. Questions: 1. Can Vitamin D supplements increase calcium levels? 1b. is blood calcium level of 10.2 considered high? (since ive taken another 50000iu dose since blood test, i wonder if could be higher now.) 2. Anyone experience dehydration/increased urination from ergocalciferol? 2b. Could the dehydration be from the Vit d supplement itself? Or could it possibly be from higher calcium levels? 3. I've read that high-dose vitamin d supplementation might not be the best, and to look at taking D3 instead. What is the general thought on this? 4. Could part of the vit D deficiency be from the rapid weight loss i sustained while i had gastritis and was afraid to eat anything? 5. What can i do to lower calcium levels? Stopping D2 supplement? take Magnesium? 6. Can just simply being dehydrated increase blood calcium levels? I'm feeling much better after getting over those GI issues, i'm just trying to figure out why i feel so dehydrated all the time, urinating so much, dry mouth, etc. I had A1C and blood glucose checked and all are completely normal. I was starting to consider a thing called Diabetes Insipidus, but i am not thirsty all the time and i found vitamin D supplementation could have similar side effects of dehydration. Thinking i might stop the ergocalciferol and see if dehydration symptoms subside. Then try daily D3 supplement after some time... Any thoughts on this? How long could this take to correct? Thanks for reading!\n",

      "Hi, I'm looking for some advice. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in April 2018 but I'm not sure if it was because I asked to see a specialized that they offered to treat me. Initial blood labs were done by general doctor. Endocrinologist said it was hypothyroidism and mentioned possibly Hashimotos. My main complaint was being cold and brain fog. I was started on Levoxyl 25 mcg at this visit under the endocrinologist direction. At this point in January 2019 I've never seen much different in body heat and brain fog seems a wee bit better but not much. Anxiety has gone up a lot!

      "Hello everyone, My name is Nat. I have recently been going through a worsening of my anxiety, depression and OCD Symptoms, and after dealing with this for about three weeks, i have begun to wonder if it's possible that it could be related to my thyroid. About a year ago, I gotten testing done my my results for my TSH was 4.97. I know this is the normal range 0.450-4.500 (uIU/mL). T4 - 1.37. But didn't receive medication or anything. I don't know much about the thyroid and it's conditions, so I am not sure if it could be related. Though I have been experiencing the physical symptoms of Hypo. Such as, Hair loss Dry skin Constipation Weight Issues etc. Mentally, I can't concentrate on much. Have Obsessive thinking that has seem to have gotten worse. Weird Intrusive thoughts and just feeling overall anxious, and getting depressed. I see a Psych and Therapist, am prescribed medication for over 5 years now. And I believe I was doing okay for a time. Until I stopped the antidepressant, but started it up again. But since I never really thought about the thyroid I wanted to know if it can be an issue? I am getting blood work done again tomorrow. Thanks for reading!\n",
      "UPDATE: Thyroid removed 3-13-18 and put on 112 synthroid(name brand) 6 day after surgery Recently T4 went up higher and I began having the stomach issues once again and diarrhea. I also have had some rapid heartbeat, up to 120 on occasion so am unable to stop the Propranolol entirely which I would like to do, so I can also stop the Eliquis. But until they are sure I am stable on synthroid and no risk of A-fib my cardiologists want me to take the Propanolol or wean off, but take it heart rate goes up. As long it still goes up they fear A-Fib and risk of stroke so are insistent I stay on it for now. Thursday 4/25, night I woke up at 4 AM with extremely bad stomach pains, drenched in sweat and had diarrhea. I took immodium and went back to sleep. Woke up around 7 AM with it again, took my Synthroid and went back to sleep. Around 11 AM it began again and this time it was just bright red blood with clear mucous so I called my gastro and then called my cardiologists because they have me on Eliquis. They said go to ER to rule out a bleed from the Eliquis. ER did cat scan, labs, stool samples etc. but insisted I stay overnight to monitor. I saw the gastro the next day( 8 days ago), no more blood and he cleared me to go home and said it was colitis and IB most likely. I was on a heart monitor the entire time and they saw no more A-Fib but did catch a couple periods of tachycardia. Not bad but once up to 128 just from walking a few feet to the bathroom. They gave me the propranolol and it went down. They did run labs on Free T4 and TSH but not T3. Anyway . the T4 is up since my labs and the TSH is down. T4 is now higher than it has ever been. They said to call my endocrinologist and let him know T4 was now 1.77 (0.76-1.46) HIGH. I was released the next day and called the office and spoke with my endo on call Saturday and endo on call said skip Synthroid Sunday and then take 1/2 of 112 Synthroid on Monday and call my regular endo on Monday, which I did. He changed me from 112 to 100 Synthroid based on T4 up and TSH heading downward.. I am due for labs on May 6, tomorrow. Yesterday and today I am feeling worse . that cold feeling I had before the Synthroid kicked in is returning, so is the tired, achy feeling, I am tempted to just start back on the 112 before he gets the new labs.

      "Good afternoon, My daughter has seen an endocrinologist for the past 7 years. They have always taken a wait and see approach. This year she is 14 and has had frequent headaches along with tiredness, more so than normal. The PCM ordered initial labs that came back negative for Mono/EBV. However, it showed a significant Vitamin D deficiency (18 IU) and elevated TSH at 6.9. The PCM immediately ordered repeat labs to include antibody tests. The TSH came back down but it was positive for TPO antibodies at 108 IU> The PCM then put in a referral to the Endo (we have seen for years) and ordered an US prior to the apportionment. The US came back with bilateral multinodular thyroid with the largest 2 measuring at 5MM each tin the lower pole of the left thyroid. I want to be sure we advocate for her at this point, She is clearly symptomatic with several factors reflecting thyroiditis and what I think is probably Hashimoto;s disease. Any suggestions? Should we ask for biopsies? Should we advocate for treatment? Thank You Jennifer\n",

My doctor wants to remove my thyroid due to the size of the nodules. i'm not experiencing any symptoms other than fullness in my neck and sometimes food gets stuck while eating.

      "I had hyperactive parathyroid levels of 128 in June of 2017, it was tagged as high, but dr never mentioned it to me. Then in June of 2018 again the parathyroid level was even higher at 192. The dr wanted to rule out that it was a secondary hyperactive parathyroid and put me on vitamin D, which took it down to normal level of 67 in Oct 2018. Now my vitamin D has significantly increased from 15 to 30, but the parathyroid hormone has risen again to 87, which is only slightly high. Had an ultrasound yesterday morning and called saying I have a 1.8 cm nodule on my thyroid and they were making me an urgent appointment with an endocronologist. I'm afraid things have been ignored or not taken seriously until now and wonder how long I've had this nodule and where has it spread? Any words of encouragement or information would be helpful.

      "Hi all- My husband and daughter have had thyroid nodules for years so I wasn't too excited when I reviewed my records and saw this on multiple MRI/CTs: \"T2 hyperintense nodule within the right thyroid lobe\". It has been there since at least 2017 and nobody at Kaiser ever mentioned it to me. I requested an ultrasound in Feb-2019 which showed: Right Lobe: Homogeneous echogenicity. It measures 1.7 x 1.3 x 4.3 cm. 8 x 8 x 10 mm partially cystic nodule with microcalcifications Left Lobe: Homogeneous echogenicity. It measures 1.6 x 1.1 x 4.5 cm. 9 x 5 x 10 mm partially cystic nodule with microcalcifications Isthmus: It measures 0.2 cm in thickness. 7 x 3 x 8 mm ovoid hypoechoic nodule. No mention of lymph nodes, vascularity, location on the report. My PCP referred me to endocrinology, and they responded to her saying: \"They [endos] did not think that the cysts appeared worrisome and felt that monitoring them with another ultrasound in 1 year\". I'm under the impression that basing risk only on size is \"out\" and that microcalcifications and hypoechogenicity are cause for concern, particularly with nodules located in the isthmus. I do get that most of these are benign, but does \"go away and come back in year\" (when it will have been 3 years) sound like an appropriate response to you folks? Thanks\n",
      "I'm scheduled for a biopsy for a nodule on my left thyroid that was found around 8 years ago, under 1cm, that has decided to make a definite growth spurt over the past 2 years. I believe my nodule growth spurt began in the fall of 2017 when I experienced a very sore throat and extreme hoarseness over a 4 month period that my doctor could find no cause. Within the next 6 months I started having trouble swallowing and labored breathing when exerting myself, and was sent to a speech therapist who scheduled a barium swallow which I cancelled and stopped seeing her because I felt I wasn't seeing the right type of doctor for my problems. In hindsight I probably should have had the barium swallow, it might have picked up this nodule pushing against my throat as I believe it is. I'm hopeful that maybe some of my discomfort can be relieved during the biopsy if some of the fluid can be drained out of the nodule if it is fluidy.\n",
      "So a little back story. I've had a sore throat for a good 5 months. Off and on feeling of something in my throat for at least a year. Had an endoscopy and saw 2 ENT's, the most recent ENT visit this past January, everything was good. Did have my esophagus dilated but nothing found. Fast forward to last week, I just kept getting a nagging feeling that my sore throat wasn't normal. Dr felt my thyroid/throat and only ordered an ultrasound because I asked and he felt my thyroid was slightly enlarged. I have gotten my results back from the ultrasound and I think I understand them but maybe someone can read this and clarify it more: Findings: gland is mildly enlarged and demonstrates a heterogeneous echotexture. The right lobe measures 5.0X1.4X1.5cm. The left lobe measures 4.9X1.6X1.4cm. There are multiple small solids nodules in either lobe. On the right side, 4 solid well-circumscribed nodules are noted all appearing hypoechoic. The largest of these is noted in the midportion of the right lobe, measuring 9X7X7 mm. The other well-circumscribed solid nodules have a similar appearance and all measure 7 mm in diameter or less. In the left lobe, 3 small well-circumscribed hypoechoic solid nodules are noted. The largest of these is noted in the midportion of the lobe measuring 8X6X3 mm. The other nodules measure 6mm in diameter or less. Impression: Multiple small well-circumscribed solid nodules in either lobe as detailed above. Suggest follow-up thyroid sonogram in 9-12 months time. So with all that being said, I immediately started googling and found thyroid cancer is pretty rare however, I came across anaplastic cancer and scared the crap out of myself. My dr is having me go to yet a different ENT in 2 weeks and see what they say. I'm very scared. Especially if it turns out to be the anaplastic kind. Of course my mind goes to worst case. Any insight would be awesome. Thank you so much Tonya\n",
      "Good evening I am 36 years old and I have recently been dealing with thyroid issues. I went to my doctor and all he tested was my TSH,so I found a naturopath who listened and understood my symptoms. I had a full thyroid panel done. My TSH was normal 1.65,free t3 was very low ,free t4 was very low and my thyroid antibodies were at 16. My naturopath put me on 60mg desicated thyroid in the AM and mid afternoon 5mcg cytomel I felt great for about two weeks but then I felt the exact same again. Still bloated,tired and sluggish. 3 months on my meds and we checked my blood my t4 DROPPED from 11.1 to 9.1 which is below the reference range. My t3 went up from 3.32 to 3.86 My doctor then upped my desicated thyroid to 90 mg and t3 15mg Today I did blood work for something separate and my TSH is 0.02!!!!!! *** why is my thyroid getting weaker ? Im so confused. I dont know if I should stop going to her and go see an actual endocrinologist?? PLEASE help if you can. Any advice would be greatly appreciated\n",

      "Hello all, I am looking for any experiences/advice as how to move forward. I have a family history of thyroid issues going back four generations. I just hit my 30s and have been feeling like I am showing signs of hypothyroid: fatigue, cold, depression, difficulty losing weight, dry brittle hair, dry rashy skin, cracking nails, muscle aches, low libido, weirdly elevated LDL etc. My tests results came back incredibly normal (TSH 1.5, T4 8.2, Free T3 3.1, Ferritin 48) except for T3 Uptake: 22% (range 24%-39%) Free T4: .98 (range .82-1.77 but seems a bit low) My understanding from attempting to read science articles is that this could be a number of things not delivering enough accessible hormones and giving me symptoms of hypo even if my thyroid functioning correctly... an estrogen or testosterone issue to a nutritional deficiency to a pituitary issue to stress to some other systemic disorder. Ack! Could this still be early subclinical hypothyroid? Would it be worth getting an antibodies test for Hashimotos? Any other ideas of other lab tests that might be helpful? Anybody have similar results? I have awful, high deductible health insurance so am wary of going to an endocrinologist until I feel more convinced they are not going to just say everything is perfectly normal.

      "I could use some guidance. I have multiple nodules on my thyroid. One shrunk from last year, one stayed the same, and one grew. I've had them biopsied the past 2 years and they are not cancer.

My Dr did blood work and my tsh is 1.58 and my free t4 is 2.38 (normal range .58-1.64) so he said it looks like hyperthyroidsm. I felt relieved that my symptoms finally had a cause but my Dr then did a free t4 by dialysis and that came back at 1.8 (normal 1.1-2.4) so I'm in the normal range. He said everything looks good so he'll see me in a year. Has anyone ever had results like this and had symptoms of hyper but are told you're normal? I don't know where to do go from here or what I should do. I've felt so bad for so long. Every year I tell my Dr all my symptoms and I have labs done and I'm told they're normal.

The doctor tried to add a T3 supplement. I didn't tolerate it well. My TSH numbers have not been below 40 and it's been as high as 70. I have always been hypothyroid never hyperthyroid. I am unsure what to try next. One strange thing is I suffered 2nd & 3rd degree burns over 10% of my body. I was in the burn unit for a few days. During that time I didn't take my thyroid medication. I feel better without the Synthroid. I had acid reflux that was causing me to take the maximum dose of every antacid there is.. I am eating the same if not more.. you need more calories when you have been burnt. But have not had reflux since not taking the Synthroid. I take in under 1500 calories a day and under 25 grams of carbs and I am still 25-35 pounds overweight. Has anyone else had the problem with Synthroid causing reflux and anxiety ? Has anyone else had there TSH over 40 for years ? Thanks for any advice anyone may have about this.\n",
      "I have hypothyroidism and I have had a couple instances in which my adam's apple aches. I have also experienced shooting pain up the side of my neck in my throat. My Dr. just shrugs and says it is probably a nerve thing. The pain in my adam's apple was a deep gripping ache that lasted for about five seconds at a time. The pain in the side of my neck is sharper and lasts a fraction of a second. I also feel like the left side of my neck is heavy when I bend over. Almost like there is a cable running through it with invisible strings pulling the cable down. Again when I spoke to my physician about the sensation he just shrugs.\n",
      "I'm new here. I'd really appreciate some help with my results. My doc is encouraging me to do radioactive iodine treatment. I'm hesitant. These were my test results in July: TSH 0.06 FT4 0.78 FT3 4.4 I'm finding no resources for low tsh and ft4 with high ft3. Doc adjusted my methimazol dose, I gained 10lbs and my results two weeks ago are: TSH 0.23 FT4 0.9 FT3 3.0 I'm having trouble sleeping and concentrating, have a high heart rate, but also can't lose any weight. Doc says it can't be a pituitary issue since the FT3 is elevated. I'm don't know what to think.\n",

      "Im new to this board. Diagnosed with hypothyroid 6 months ago. My first TSH was 259 which was off the charts and FT4 0.4. I tested negative for Hashimoto and endo believes my thyroid shut down due to taking overdose of iodine supplements. Ive been taking synthroid at various levels and my thyroid started to improve and went off of it in October. My numbers have since gone back up/down. My TSH is 11.45 and my FT4 is 0.89. They have me back on 25mcg of synthroid. Last month they also found out my ferritin was 20 so Ive been on iron supplements. My question is related to symptoms. Ive read about all the hypo symptoms on sites and I dont see much about numbness and tingling I feel in my arms and sometimes legs. I do also have cold hands and feet but this is like pins and needles and my muscle feel like they are burning. Has anyone else experienced this? I know some say neuropathy results from weight gain but Im the opposite. Im thin and underweight!\n",
      "Hi Everyone. I was just recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I was diagnosed with a goiter about 5 years ago. Ever since Ive had my thyroid levels checked once a year to make sure everything is ok. Earlier this month I went for a routine physical and I asked the doctor to re-check all of my lab work including my thyroid. I was concerned about fatigue, hand tremors and muscle weakness. The thyroid level TSH is normal, but the T4 level is elevated. Now that Ive been researching thyroid problems Im realizing that I have more than a few of the symptoms. Never tied it all together before now. Symptoms include the goiter, fatigue, hand tremors, muscle weakness, hot flashes, increased appetite, trouble losing weight, hairs on neck and double vision. I have an appointment with an endocrinologist on 1/28/19. Just looking for advice and support regarding this new diagnosis. Thanks. JJ\n",

      "About 9 months ago I began to experience double-vision --vertical with the second image (under the real image) displayed at an angle. Vision is clear if I close one eye at a time. If I raise my head a few inches I can see more clearly. Current diagnosis is 4th nerve palsy of unknown cause. After several eye doctor visits and a clear MRI, no cause has been discovered. Has anyone experienced this problem? It may be thyroid related. I have had no trauma to my head. I do take 75 mg of Armour thyroid daily. All blood tests came back normal, including for Myasthenia Gravis. Has anyone experienced this problem? Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!\n",
      "Hi all, After going gluten free some months ago (yes I was off the charts gluten sensitive) and developing hyper symptoms due to better absorption (rapid pulse, high pulse pressure, loose bowels, etc) I've \"stepped down\" from 120 mcg Levothyroxine to 50 mcg Levothyroxine. Oct 15 I dropped from 75 mcg to 50 mcg. Four weeks later on Nov 15 my TSH was 6.4 (as expected, a bit high as my body was adjusting to less meds). However, staying on 50 mcg my next blood test 2 weeks later showed TSH at 3.2 and then again two weeks later TSH is down to 2.1. Doc thinks I am absorbing Levothyroxine much better and I am going to step down again to 25 mcg. I continue to have the hyper symptoms (loose bowels, high pulse pressure, racing heart, sweating at night, weakness) on and off but mostly on. Also my antibodies prior to gluten free was 140 but since gluten free have been in normal range with quarterly checks. Also my only nodule has disappeared. Vitamins/nutrients all good and excellent health other than my thyroid.\n",
      "My labs are: TSH 2.52 Free T4 0.67 I take 120 mg of Armour daily, which was increased from 90, only because I requested it a few months ago. I continue to gain weight and struggle with most of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, although i have seen some improvement. Recommendations? Could my low T4 indicate a pituitary problem, and if so is there a natural way to supplement? TIA! Debbi\n",
      "I was previously on 125mcg Levothyroxine & 25mcg Liothyronine daily. My doc left the area & the new one insisted on trying Nature-throid instead. Seemed cool because it's all natural. Thing is, he put me on 97.5mg of Nature-throid & I feel AWFUL...as bad as I did before I was first diagnosed. I have another 3 wks before the next lab & office visit & I honestly don't know if I can make it that long! Isn't he severely UNDER-dosing me compared to what I was on before?\n",
      "Since the change in Naturethroid formulation, I have gone hypo with a bunch of symptoms. To name a few; fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, brain fog, depression and dry skin. My labs are a mess too. My TSH is almost non existent and my Free T3 and Free T4 are both low too. When the shortage happened in the fall of 2017. I had enough of the old formulation to get me through five months. Once I started purchasing the new formulation (3/19), everything changed. I didnt put things together until I read that others were experiencing my exact issues. Has anyone experienced this with the new Naturethroid? If so, how did you handle it?\n",

      "I have been told I have a couple of nodules (including complex nodule - 9mm) that my primary had MRI'd. Nodules discovered in a CT scan after a car accident. I have been trying to get an appointment with the endocrinologist for 3 weeks and this seems to be very long. Is this so minor and not serious that it can just wait like this? Or should I get a different referral? No clue what to do.\n",
      "In the next couple of weeks I'm going to be having a hemithyroidectomy. I've suffered with hyperthyroidism for 3 years as I have a single, large, complex, hot nodule. I've had two fna, and luckily they showed a benign mass. But it's grown, maybe a couple of cm. It was 6cm back in 2015, now it's about 9cm. I was nervous for the surgery so decided to read experiences of a hemithyroidectomy and ended up reading a lot about false negative fna and thyroid cancer with large nodules like mine. But mine is obviously \"toxic\" and I was told that's a good thing. I've had other symptoms for these last years, such as hoarseness and pain, and reactive lymph nodes in the neck. The fna was painful and they withdrew a large amount of blood stained fluid from the nodule in an attempt to decrease the size and for testing, but its complex and the more fluid they removed the more it grew and now its mostly solid and pretty uncomfortable. I can't help thinking this is pretty big and has started growing behind my sternum and it might not be benign after all. My endo did say they won't know for sure until they test it. But most are benign. I know worrying does no good, but I can't help it.\n",
      "Hello! I am a Type 1 diabetic (37yrs) & a hypothyroid victim (19yrs) That being said, I have started getting daily headaches mixed with occasional migraines. I have been on Amour Thyroid for about 1yr now & do feel much-much better than when I was on Synthroid, but my blood work has never been on par. I feel these headaches are thyroid related. So I was considering adding Cytomel back into the 'game' along with the Amour. Here are my latest results: TSH .44 FT4 .71 FT3 4.5 1.25gr Amour Thyroid I have reduced the Amour to 1gr. Will the Cytomel help bring the lows up & lower the FT3? I'm on my 5th doctor now. It is so hard to find one that is willing to go outside of the normal handing out more meds. I take Amour @ 6am every day, but I've noticed consistently at about 1:30'ish (pm) I get heart palpitations. & no is not low blood sugar. I am very active, not overweight & usually very healthy. I rarely get sick. I just am not feeling 'okay', & I want to get rid of these headaches. Just wanted to see if anyone has had similar symptoms. Thank you to all that provide advise.\n",

      "Well from suspicious cells from a slightly grown nodule to receiving that i am high risk from a genetic test, I am scheduled to have a thyroidectomy on December 7th and I am so scared. Supposely the surgeon says its not cancer at this time but the sooner i take it out, the less chance of getting cancer. I am so scared that I won't find the right balance with sinthroid or any of the others. I took sinthroid for like a few days and could not take it. It totally made me feel as though I am going to jump out of my body! I am afraid that I may come down now with all these health issues because my hormones won't adapt from medication. I will be turning 60 shortly. Can anyone share their experience with me please? I am really anxious/nervous. Has anyone gone to a naturopath after a thyroidectomy? Has anyone tried different thyroid hormone replacement that is more natural or easy for the body to adapt compared to sinthroid? Help!\n",

      "Over the past year I have noticed a few changes in my body. The big one is weight gain. I have gained over 30 pounds in a year and I have no idea why. If this happened a few years ago I could tell you it was because of my diet and lack of exercise. However in the past year I have significantly improved my diet and have started exercising more. Yet I gained all this weight and can't seem to get the scale to drop. The next one is fatigue. I am so tired and (again) do not know why. My fiance has expressed concerned with how tired I am. Most days if I could just stay in bed and sleep I would. Coffee has become my best friend. The next is my sex drive. What was there is no longer there. It is causing some tension between my fiance and I. I have noticed a difficulty in concentrating. The fatigue plays a part in that, but even those times I am not tired I find myself making silly mistakes. Many people have suggested getting my thyroid checked. My doctor ordered a TSH and I came out at 3.7 (within the normal range). She never really addressed my other symptoms, but said the weight gain was just my body changing as I got older. I am at my wits end here. I know my levels are in a normal range, but a list of symptoms has all I am experiencing (plus the ones I didn't put on here). I am reaching out to people who have experience with these kinds of disorders. Is normal really normal?\n",

I am wondering at what age any of you started to give the medicine right upon waking and then having your little one wait an hour to eat. This is how he will eventually need to take the medicine. Our doc said as long as he takes it the exact same way everyday, then we dont need to worry too much about it yet. He currently eats breakfast, waits and hour to get med, and then waits an hour for any kind of snack. Its getting hard in that waiting for the snack phase if hes seeing other kids/toddlers eat. But then I wonder if hes too little to make wait to eat an hour upon waking. Thanks! Lisa\n",

      "In late August, I got bloodwork back after pushing for it...I'm a chronic pain patient (old acct here from lumbar surgery) so some fatigue is just my normal but I felt awful. I had seriously elevated EBV numbers (40 now, mono at 23) which the doc called chronic viral fatigue syndrome. Recommended rest and lots of protein. Did not recheck those... I also was newly diagnosed as hypothyroid. I know my TSH wasn't horrid, but at 5.5 could be better. I started 25mg of levothyroxine. Yesterday the nurse called to say to double up my last remaining dose and that the doc was calling in a 50mg script. I just got the new bloodwork report in the mail. My TSH rose and is now 7.81. Free T3 and T4 w/in range (3.2 and 1.2). Why would the TSH jump? I do have a basic understanding of how the three pieces interact. I don't recall prior numbers on the T3 and T4...though seems like the real goal is managing those and TSH is how the body does that. I understand adjusting and fine tuning take time, but it seems odd that my brain would be yelling even louder when my thyroid is getting some help\n",
      "Hey everyone! I'm being treated for Hypo with Levothyroxine, and have been for maybe a year, or a little less, by my naturopath. It has helped SO much. This is more of a curiosity question than anything else..... I've had heart problems my whole life (I have a few, non serious congenital issues), and ever since being put on Levo, my heart rate has normalized. It doesn't get erratic as often, it feels calmer. My anxiety is better, etc. I always thought that Levo would make my heart rate higher/anxiety worse. It's been a really great and very definite change that my doctor and I are very happy about. Has anyone else had this experience? Also, I'm a fairly small person, 5'3\" and about 125 lbs (I actually gained weight since being treated as I was gaunt before) but my dose is 225mcg, which i've read is high for my weight. But if i take even 1/4 less I get palpitations. Before this my western medicine doc said I had no thyroid problem. It all seems so weird to me, my naturopath clearly has things right as I feel much better. But why so high a dose works for me when my levels were never crazy out of wack is so strange. Anyone else relate?\n",
      "As part of miscarriage/fertility investigations I had my thyroid function tested last year and was told it was 'normal'. I have had it tested a lot in past when presenting symptoms but always came back 'normal'. I am now seeing a new Dr and he advised having them retested again. I will be sending him the results which again I am told are normal, but I am wondering if anyone with more understanding could look at the results and give any opinion. I was concerned that last years FSH was above 2.5 mu/l, although it was still in the normal range I have read that above 2.5 is linked with miscarriage? What is confusing me more is the normal scale is different on both sets of tests, although both show 'normal' my T4 this time would be 'abnormal' if you were to use the scale at the previous lab!

      "Hi everyone: I have been sick for 8 months now. I hope somebody out there will have the patience to read this. 1. I got shingles first 2. At the same time I had a couple of nosebleeds that lasted over 4 hours. 3. Of course I then became anemic 4. After shingles cleared, I got the painful complication afterwards and still have it - post herpetic neuralgia. 5. Also a blood test showed that I have hypothyroidism and I've been trying to get the right dosage now for 5 months. When I first became sick I was very out of breath almost all the time. It was so bad, when I took a shower I wasn't sure I could finish I was having such a hard time breathing. Did the anemia contribute to this, I don't know, but as I got healthier I wasn't so out of breath, although it hasn't gone away completely. Lately I'm out of breath mainly in the morning. I have almost no problem with this in the afternoon or evening and this is what has me so confused. I mean, if it is COPD wouldn't it always bother me? I was prescribed Synthroid about 5 months ago, but 3 times the dosage was lowered. I just got my dose increased about 3 weeks ago and am wondering if it is finally the right dose and maybe that is why I am starting to feel better. Could I be starting COPD or could this breathing trouble be generated by the thyroid problem? I have read a lot on this board about breathing problems with hypothyroidism, but no one mentions needing medication for this. Is an inhaler required, or do we just wait until the right thyroid meds kick in to solve this dilemma. I am a 72 year old female and I did smoke for many years but quit almost a year ago, not that that will change anything. I do realize that if my lungs were damaged, there is no cure, and I must now pay for all those years of smoking. No freebies, right? It has just been a rather difficult time for me lately and I'm hoping someone can offer an opinion or suggestion about what's happening to me and possibly what I can do about it. Thank you so much for your interest.\n",
      "I am going to make this as short and to the point as possible in hopes of getting some advice or maybe clarity on my current thyroid issues, I can't get this off of my mind and am hoping for some encouragement and support to help get me through these next couple of weeks. I am a 25 year old female that was diagnosed with a multi nodular goiter at the age of 16 (my primary care doctor first felt this in my neck upon a routine check up and referred me to a pediatric endocrinologist). I was treatment by a pediatric endocrinologist until I was 18 and then had to be transferred to an adult endo as she could no longer treat me as an adult. Upon my treatment with the pediatric endocrinbologist, she watched the growth and sent me for one FNA biopsy which came back benign. At the time, I had several different sized cysts on the right lobe of my thyroid which were biopsied, all of which came back benign. I had NO nodules on the left lobe of my thryoid. This is in 2012. Fast forward to 2014, the right side of my thyroid and neck had started severly causing me pain, so me endocrinologist opted to remove the right side ONLY as I had no nodules on the left side of my thyroid. I had a partial lobectomy which removed the right side of my thryoid and all of the cysts which were on it, The final pathology after surgery came back benign. Low and behold, just a few short months after having the partial thyroidectomy, a solid nodule appeared during a routine ultrasound check up on the left side of my thyroid. For years my new Endocrinologist has not seemed or acted concerned about this at all and did not even continue ultrasounds or biopsies on this nodule to ensure this wasn't malignant. She took the \"wait and see\" approach, which several times I complained to her or severe neck pain and tenderness and she brushed it off as it was scar tissue from my partial thyroidectomy. The last ultrasound I had showed a 1cm nodule on the left side of my thyroid in April 2016. My doctor once again wanted to wait and see if the size increased. Here, we are September 2018, I switched doctors because I did not feel confident in her \"wait and see\" approach. I had an ultrasound completed on the left side of my neck last week which I have attached the results below, it now shows my nodule has grew to 2 cm. They mentioned that they compared it to previous CT Scans I had completed at the hospital for two automobile accidents and it has grew in size slightly. For a year now I have been having these weird pains in my neck which almost feel like someone is taking a balloon and blowing it up, a feeling of fullness and just a tenderness throughtout my neck. I am now a nervous wreck and severely depressed from researching as it appears you wouldn't have pain until it has spread into your lymph nodes and surrounding bones. I am literally scared to death, I don't think I've ever been this scared in my life. I know google is your own worst enemy when going through this, but from googling this, the report of \"MIXED ECHOGENICITY\" almost always signifies Cancer, as does it having blood flow within the nodule!! I do also know the tiny mass they found at the bottom has not been there in previous scans. I am so confused by this thyroid ultrasound and my doctor was not very informative when he called to give the results. They are referring me back to have a FNA Biopsy soon, I just have the worst feeling about this and am mostly scared to death \"what if\" this nodule has been cancer for years and my doctor just blowed it off? From anyones prior experience, have you had any of these symptoms with cancer and IF it would have been cancer years ago, would it have grew more rapidly that just 1cm to 2cm? IF this were to turn out to be malignant, would it be too late if it has indeed been cancer all of these years since 2015? I will take any experiences/words of advice/encouragement I can get at this point as my family is not supportive at all and acts as is this is nothing when to me this is EVERYTHING. I am a single mother to a 5 year old little girl and am scared to death of this being the worst imaginable. I am having severe anxiety just waiting on a biopsy appointment and cannot eat, sleep or stop these raging thoughts. Thank you all so much in advance and bless you all!! FINDINGS The right lobe is absent. The left lobe measures 5.8 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm. There is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm nodule in the left lobe. It is mixed echogenicity. Color Doppler shows blood flow within it. There is a tiny 3 mm finding at the lower pole of the left lobe Conclusion Dominant solid nodule left thyroid. It may be very slightly larger than on prior CT neck with contrast from 02/24/2014 and it is about the same as on the CT cervical spine from 08/30/2016. Status post right lobectomy.\n",
      "I have 6 nodules in my thyroid after an ultrasound. Im asymptomatic, no goitre and my labs are normal. I have two in the left lobe approximately 3cmx2cmx2cm classified as heterogeneous with cystic areas and coarse calcification. In the right lobe I have 3 small nodules approx .8cm each and a larger hypoechoic lesion with calcification measuring approximately 1cm. Im trying to decide if I should go through with the biopsy. Im terrified it will hurt and Im not sure its needed. I feel like odds are very low of having 6 malignant spots. Anyone else had multiple nodules turn out cancerous?\n",
      "I am a 56 year old female. When I was in my 20's a doctor felt like I could benefit from thyroid medication. He did not do bloodwork at the time. Later I was told my labwork was fine and taken off. More recently another doctor put me on thyroid medication. My TSH was maybe around 3 but then my levels went into hyperthyroid range and she said T3 and T4 were normal so my general internist took me off again. The past couple years I have had steady weight gain, muscle and joint pain, noticeable upper abdomen fat and many other symptoms and my TSH was 4.12 . Should I request more thyroid bloodwork? Could it be something else. I don't want to go on thyroid medication if it is going to make me have hyperthyroidism. New to board so any advise appreciated.\n",
      "Have a Dr. visit coming up and a chance to see a different Dr. in the Endo practice. My Dr. doesn't believe in T3 - only levothyroxine - but I understand that this dr. will prescribe NDT or T3/T4. So I'm trying to figure out if my lab results back up a conversion problem. I have Hashimoto's and am currently taking 125 mcg of levo and have a bunch of ongoing symptoms (constipation/IBS, hair loss, cold feet, edema, low energy, inability to lose weight, distraction, etc). I'm on a low FODMAP diet and take a variety of supplements. Lab results: TSH 2.01 (.4 - 4.5) FT3 2.4 (2.3 - 4.2) FT4 1.1 (.8 - 1.8)\n",
      "A little background info on myself, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and high blood pressure during my pregnancy in early 2016. My doctor put me on Synthroid 50 mcg which I took until September 2017 when I switched doctors and was then placed on Levothyroxine 50mcg. I never noticed any difference or symptoms of having hypothyroidism besides hair loss. Being a new mom, I was always tired and never thought it could be from my thyroids. In February of 2018, I got the flu for the first time in 10 years and then got it a second time a couple of weeks after. Since then it's been a rollercoaster of crazy symptoms such as constant dizziness, brain fog, feeling lightheaded, difficulty concentrating, also had chest pain at one point (could be when my doctor tried to change my blood pressure medicine). My doctor ran several tests and couldn't find anything other than vitamin D deficiency. I've been taking vitamin D3 since April to correct it. I also saw a cardiologist and had a stress test, EKG and echocardiogram due to the chest pain I felt at that time. Everything was normal. Cardiologist said my heart was in great shape. The chest pain eventually went away. Getting frustrated with not getting any answers, I switched doctors a month ago. My new doctor immediately thought about my thyroids after seeing my bloodwork from my previous doctor. My last test with previous doctor was done on 6/04/18 (while still on levothyroxine) with the results of Thyroxine (T4) 9.3 (range 4.5-12.0 ug/dl); Free thyroxine index 3.2 (range 1.2 - 4.9) and TSH 3.020 (range 0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL). I've been researching loads and now know that my FT3 and FT4 should have been checked as well. My current doctor wanted to put me on Armour 60 mg which is definitely something I wanted to try. I started taking it on 8/5/18. Within the first couple of days I noticed a big difference. My dizziness had decreased and I was able to concentrate better. After the 5th day of taking the Armour I started to get heart palpitations only at night while resting. A week later I started to get chest pressure that felt similar to the chest pain I had earlier in the year. I called my doctor and he believed it could be the Armour causing the palpitations. I cut down my dose to 30 mg on 8/18 and within a couple of days the heart palpitations subsided but I still had the chest pressure. Blood was ran on 8/21 (the day on which I was told to take my 30 mcg dose that morning and bloodwork was drawn that evening) FT3 2.8 pg/mL (range 2.2 pg/mL - 4.0 pg/mL); FT4 1.03 ng/dL (range 0.76 ng/dL - 1.46 ng/dL); TSH 5.087 mIU/L (range 0.360 mIU/L - 3.740 mIU/L)(HIGH). My doctor believed that these results were from taking 60 mg and not from the couple of days that I reduced to 30 mg. He wants me to up my dose to 90 mg and retest on 10/1. He doesn't seem too concerned about the chest pressure since I was previously seen by cardiologist a few month ago. I believe he mentioned taking something for indigestion but my pressure doesn't go away after belching. He also wants me to eat organic and start exercising (I'm about 40 lbs overweight). I am slowly increasing my dose to the 90 mg by 15 mg every 10 days. I am currently on 45 mg, no heart palpitations, still have chest pressure but seems to have decreased in intensity. I am terrified that this medicine will give me a heart attack or stroke because of the chest pressure. Any advice?\n",

      "Hi All- Ive been having a strange symptom lately and wondered if any of you could tell me if this is a familiar thing with your Thyroid issues. About two months ago, started waking up in the mornings feeling my legs were weak and shaky on the inside...nothing I could physically feel outside. It would usually last all day, but at times would randomly go away for a few hours or half a day. That has been consistent for two months. Then, about 2 weeks ago, I started getting numbness and tingling in my left leg and my right forearm and hand (first my leg for 4h, then my arm a couple days later for an hour or two). After that, my leg numbness and tingling has returned once for a couple hours...but my hand and forearm has remained feeling weak and different. It feels like after your hand falls asleep and starts to wake up...kind of slow and harder to move. Im able to move it and use it fine, but the feeling is very odd. As a side note, my arm continues to fall asleep several times a night when I sleep with my usual hand under my pillow position (which has never happened before). So, I dont know if my hand feeling is reacting to having that happen all night. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Anyone had this with thyroid issues? Especially, located to one or two extremities? I should also mention, I had a 2 or 3mm nodule found 8 months ago and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (TSH level 4.57) at that time. I was placed on Levothyroxine 50mcg at the time and checked 3 months later (TSH 2.34). Lost my health insurance until this Saturday, so I havent been able to check for any changes. Could my thyroid levels change that drastically to cause me issues in 5 months? Could the module be growing and causing issues? This muscle thing is kinda freakin me out! Please respond! 🙏🏻\n",

      "I had a 24hr thyroid uptake test the other day, and Zwanger just posted my results... 37.2%, and the written diagnosis on the report is hyperthyroidism. But it doesn't list any ranges. Not a big surprise, but I'm just curious what the normal range is? Googling it and I see all sorts of numbers... 25% or less... or 30% or less... Does it differ for men and women, or weight? Guess I'm just curious if my result is semi-borderline or definitely into the hyper range?\n",
      "For many years I have had the symptoms of hypo. It runs on my moms side of the family. Her mom had it but although my mother has the same symptoms she's never been diagnosed. I had my thyroid checked back in 2008 and the dr told me my levels were normal. I do not remember what it was at that time but I do recall it was the T3 test. I started researching more on hypo recently and read how the full panel needs to be done in ordered to get a proper diagnosis. So I called up my new Dr and asked if they did this which I was told yes. I get it done and recieved my labs today and see that it was only the T3 (free) that was tested. It was 3.2 and the dr tells me this is lower than he likes it and prescribes me medication. I started rereading through the sites I'd bookmarked and I'm very confused here. I read t3 is best to diagnose hyper and you need the tsh test to diagnose hypo?? I'm going to call them tomorrow but I have a feeling they'll tell me this is their standard testing. Does anyone know whether this t3 test is actually even giving me any answers? Thanks!\n",

      "Hi everyone, Ibe been having what seems to be hypothyroid symptoms for about two years now (weight gain, tired, bad constipation, dry skin, irregular months, etc.) Not doctor so far has given me the time of day about my concerns since my TSH always comes back perfectly normal. The other day my thyroid started to swell, enough my coworkers asked what was wrong, and my gyn also pointed it out at my annual. Within a few days it went down but is still enlarged. I was ordered an ultrasound which found a benign colloid cyst (3mm). I was referred to an ENT. I have a family history of hoshimotos and just want to cover my bases as they also had a very hard time getting diagnosed. Does this sound like a thyroid problem? Or is the cyst have nothing to do with the symptoms? Thanks!\n",

      "Hi everyone, For the last few years I’ve been struggling with many hypothyroid type symptoms (tiredness, fatigue, irregular bowels, dry peeling skin, weight gain, cold hands/feet etc) with no good answers from doctors as my bloodwork always comes back normal. Family history of multiple relatives with Hashimotos as well. Recently my gyno told me my thyroid seemed swollen. Over the next few days it had gotten very clearly swollen (enough my coworker noticed) then periodically would go back down. Again, my bloodwork (TSH only this time) was normal “right in the middle” I was told. Any thoughts on if there is or isn’t a thyroid problem? Is it something else causing it to swell? Thank you in advance I’m at a loss and tired of feeling tired.\n",
      "Hello! I have family history of hypothyroidism. I started to have symptoms and so began my blood work journey.

      "Years ago I was diagnosed as having Hashimoto's... with a high-normal TSH, but somewhat enlarged (and bumpy) thyroid and elevated antibodies. I was put on 50mcg of unithroid basically just to keep nodules from forming. Recently I haven't been feeling so great, and my results came back with a TSH of .07, high-normal T3/T4 and elevated TSI antibodies (think they were around 400) with slightly elevated Hashi antibodies too. So does this mean I have both Hashimoto's and Graves? My thyroid scan shows no nodules, but with minor enlargement of the gland. Can TSI be high for other reasons besides Graves? I do have a number of matching symptoms however, even without my T3/T4 being technically high.\n",
      "I am a 46 year old female. I had a biopsy this week on my thyroid. A nodule was discovered by accident on an MRI. An ultrasound revealed 4 nodules on my right thyroid. 3 are small, 1 is 2.13 cm, some hypoechoic features, some solid, and some microcalcifications. I'm scared to death because I've read that microcalcifications make it more likely to be cancer. I have no symptoms, can't feel the nodule, my thyroid hormone levels are normal, and no antibodies for hashimotos. I had my iodine levels tested and they are low, although not extreme. I'm panicking really badly and I have to wait several more days for my results. Any reassurance would be appreciated. Please no responses if yours was cancer. I need to feel some hope.

      "I recently had a partial thyroidectomy on March 8th for a suspicious nodule. The nodule was found to be benign, however they did find a small spot of cancer on the lobe they took out. My doctor seems to think most people who only have half out never need medication. My bloodwork seems to be coming back normal, however I'm still having so many symptoms of being hypo (I was also having them before surgery but now they are even worse). Before surgery I gained 35 pounds in one year, and I've been slowly gaining more after surgery as well.

      "Hi ya'll. I've been working with my Dr for some time now, because of constant forgetfulness, always tired ever increasing weight gain (in 2001 I was 180Lbs, now in 2018, I'm nearly 300Lbs), I don't eat as much as I used to, I keep telling my wife not to cook large portions, I only have 1 medium meal a day with smaller snacks of 1 or 2 lettuce and tomato sandwiches, and a few cloves of raw garlic, throughout the day, I don't touch alcohol of any kind, if I drink soda it's always diet, I very rarely drink coffee, (last time was about 3 months a ago), I used to exercise a lot and walk everywhere, but over the past year, my metabolism has been literally taking a nose dive, and my libido? Well, if it could be measured it would register -15,000 lol, and also, I'm losing my hair like there's no tomorrow, and the biggest problem I've come across is translating words into written text, IE,,,,I'm heavily relying on spell checkers to even write this message, because even though I know what I'm typing, I'm spelling the words as If I'm dyslexic, and I was never like this before. So, now I had my lab tests and everything else was normal, except TSH, the range for the test is 0.45 - 4.50, and my result was 8.25, so now I'll be taking synthroid later today for the first time, and hopefully, all this should disappear.\n",
      "I was shocked a few months ago when told my blood test showed a high number concerning my thyroid ...it was a 9. so the higher the number means your thyroid is low. so my dr put me on generic Synthroid 25mcg. he told me it wasn't much. I took it for about 2mos. then one day I woke up hurting so bad I couldn't stand it. and one time I woke crying. I was hurting on the left side of my body, esp. my left shoulder blade. over time it spread and my left arm hurt really bad. I went to a nurse practitioner and she said I must have pulled a muscle. so she said to take pain meds and some muscle relaxer. it didn't work and I couldn't take it. I got off right away. I expected it to stop hurting. it didn't. it took a long time on the pain killer I was using, so I started taking aleve and it worked. I took the muscle relaxer on occasion. I stayed off and the pain began to subside but very slowly. then I saw another dr during the time off but still in pain and he did xrays and saw nothing. that was it. well, by that time I wasn't hurting but I had gained 2pounds. I then started getting scared I would get fatter. so I got back on. ive been on abt 2wks and the pain started again. its bad. my entire left arm hurts so bad. this morning I decided I didn't want to hurt that bad so I got off. I quit cold turkey...but im not on much ...I hope this pain doesn't take a long time to stop. I made an appointment with my regular dr. I have only been seeing nurse practitioners...who don't know what is going on and only guessing. I had to find out for myself. its why I got back on and am feeling the same pain. I wonder what else I can take. im sure my dr will let me know. I have never ever had thyroid problems ...this is a first...or if I did no one ever knew about it...im huge..im way over weight...normally I have energy but not when im in this much pain. I am responsible for my mother who has alzheimers and my husband who had cancer so my stress level is up there plus im going to move...to another city. let me know anything you can.\n",
      "A little history: In 2014 when I was 16, I had an ultrasound done on my neck & they found a 3 mm partially cystic & partially solid nodule on my left lobe. They never asked me to come back in for a follow up or a repeat ultrasound in a year to check it again. Flash forward to May 2016, I was having some neck swelling so I went back. Thyroid ultrasound showed a 2nd partially cystic partially nodule on my right lobe that was 3mm. My original nodule had grown to 4mm. Bloodwork didn't show any thyroid problems. I'm now 20; I've started chocking on my food more frequently and always feel like there's something in the back of my throat. I plan on going back to my doctor this week and she will send me for another thyroid ultrasound. But i'm wondering if there's something for concern? I've also been extremely tired. I don't think these nodules could've grown to a size where they'd be causing my newer throat symptoms, but what else would?\n",
      "Hi, I am a healthy 56 year old female. Over the past few years Ive experienced an increase in days of being really washed out feeling malaise for lack of a better word. Its a significant change. I often have difficulty concentrating, frequent tinnitus, days of feeling short of breath, very dry skin, thinning hair through the temples, constipation, off and on days of vague muscle aches, resting heart rate of 54, and an increase in migraines. Out of the blue Ill have a spell where it feels like my nervous system gets switched on- Ill feel racy yet it isnt anxiety; Im certain of that. Very strong family history of thyroid disease, maternal side. Mom, aunt, female cousins. There are more symptoms that wax and wane, but this is the short list. Ive been tested for lung function, heart, brain MRI/MRA-all normal. I am slender, exercise daily, but feel terrible much of the time anymore. Pinned it on menopause, or migraines for awhile but the heavy-headed weariness just seems to be hanging on. My baseline energy level is very high, so this is not normal for me. I feel unmotivated if that makes sense. Im not depressed, however my mood does seem to dip slightly for a day or two as these symptoms worsen. My TSH has typically been 1.1-1.2 but recently jumped to 1.63 My doctor is taking these symptoms seriously and retested. Current labs showed: TSH: 1.2- (range .450-4.50) Free T3: 2.3 (range 2.0-4.4) Free T4: .98 (range .82-1.77) I had ultrasound of thyroid and have several small nodules and cysts. Next will be scan to see if any are hot. Antibodies are being tested- one came back normal, one is pending. My questions are: do these lab results point toward hypo? Could the occasional racy nervous feeling in my body (feels like my nerves are in a storm) be caused by thyroid dysfunction as well? The fact that I am slender doesnt seem to fit hypothyroid but some symptoms do. Im perplexed. Any guidance would surely be appreciated!\n",
      "Hello, I found out I had hypothyroid last summer when bloodwork showed my tsh was 15 and my free t4 was 0.9. I have been on synthroid this past year and have been on the same dose since November-ish. I just got my bloodwork back as I havent been feeling the best, and my results are: Tsh is 0.33, free t4 is 1.03 T3 (not sure free or total?) is 2.9 (range 2.4-4.2 they said). Since I had a higher tsh when the problem was first found, I dont know that they suspected any pituitary issue. I did not test positive for any hashimotos at the time. Any thoughts why my tsh would be low and my t4 not higher? Should I be thinking about pituitary? Thanks.\n",

      "Brief background- 23 year old female with a family history of thyroid cancer. About three weeks ago I had blood work done and everything was normal except my TSH levels were 0.799. My GP doesnt seem to think there is an issue with this but Im extremely concerned because my levels are lower than my Mothers were when she found out she had thyroid cancer. Furthermore Ive had a feeling like theres something kind of stuck in my throat. Not painful, but more of an aggravation. I can not get an ultrasound done on my neck without orders from my GP. Am I just overthinking this because of my family history or could this really be something I need to be concerned with?! Help!!\n",
      "Dear, Once iron levels are optimized, do we have to take less NDT? It seems I've gone hyper since correcting ferritin-levels yet I'm at the same dose as before.\n",
      "I started having Hyper symptoms (mainly fatigue) this February, went to the doc, and these were my thyroid testing results: March '18 TSH: 0,008 FT4: 2,53 Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO): higher than 1.500 Thyroglobulin antibodies: 232.1 TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb): 9.17 The doc gave me a Graves Disease diagnosis, though I lacked characteristic symptoms such as a goiter and eye disease. He put me on Methimazole 30mg. I took it and felt a slight improvement for a while before my symptoms took a turn for the worse, the fatigue intensified, and I started having Hypo symptoms such as weight gain, muscle cramps and aches, depression,etc. By May, I took some tests again. The results were such: May '18 TSH: 0,22 FT4: 0,62 He lowered the dosage to 10 mg which I took for a month before getting tested again. By June my Hypo symptoms got worse. Jun '18: TSH: 21,40 FT4: 0,85 I was taken off Methimazole, and got tested again mid July. I now have some mild Hyper symptoms again. These are my July results, showing mild Hyperthyroidism: July '18: TSH: 0,06 FT4: 1,37. Does anyone have any clue as to why I was thrown into Hypo so fast with Methimazole? And why am I oscillating between Hyper/Hypo like this?\n",
      "I just had a thyroid panel done and need help interpreting. My Dr. only will do TSH, so I did the full panel independently. Thank you for any advice.

Is this an issue? It mentions that sometimes it can be elevated due to exposure to animals (I have pets, but I'm not allergic.).\n",
      "Hi, I recently visited my Dr. complaining of anxiety, irritability, and attention issues, I am an adult male in my mid 40's. Upon examination, he said he wanted to test my thyroid levels. He measured free T4 & free T3. The T3 came back a little evelated. If the top of the range was 4.2, mine was 4.9. He ordered an radioactive T3 uptake test, my 6 hour and 24 hour uptake levels were a little elevated. for the 6 hour I think I was at 18, and 24 hour I was 40. He immediately wanted me to go on a 4 week regimen of propylthiouracil 200mg / day (100 twice daily). I did a lot of reading on it, and a lot of what I found seems to indicate that a slightly elevated free T3 in the presence of normal T4 isn't a huge cause for concern. Have others been in (or treated) a similar situation and what was the course of action? I don't like the idea of forcing my thyroid levels down and being lethargic as a result if it is unnecessary. I have been under a tremendous amount of stress due to major changes in my professional and personal life, and if I can get things under control by managing my stress levels, I'd much rather do that than deal with longer term issues related to a medication that I may not really need. Any thoughts / opinions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "Hi, All, I've had abnormal levels of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies for about 20 years (level about 210 with normal range less than 20), but no one would treat it until my TSH became higher than the normal range (of course). I went on Synthroid and felt horrible, then my doctor put me on Armour. I didn't feel any better and my free T3 and free T4 were always abysmal. At one point I was taking FIVE grains of Armour and my levels were still terrible (Free T4 was .9, with range of .8-1.9, and Free T3 was about 2.3, with range of 2.2-4.2), but my TSH was near zero. After a few years of this, I said \"Screw This!\" about 2 years ago and stopped taking any thyroid med at all without telling my doctor (not smart, I know). I figured I must not really have a thyroid problem after all. After stopping the med, I felt basically the same (terrible). Last month, my doctor insisted on checking my levels, and, unbelievably, my Free T3 and Free T4 levels are way better than they were when I was taking 5 grains of Armour (Free T3 2.9, Free T4 1.42, same ranges as above)!! He also agreed to check my Reverse T3, which was 24.9 (normal range 9.0-27.0), so \"normal\". He just said to keep taking the same dose, not knowing that I hadn't taken any meds in two years. Does anybody know why I'd have better results off thyroid meds than on them? Also, even though my Reverse T3 is high normal, could this have any effect on the results? Thanks for your help!! M\n",

      "Autoimmune? Thyroid? Parathyroid? Cancer? Pre-Diabetes? My main questions are at the bottom. History: 32 y/o white female. 5'8\" 128lbs, very active lifestyle. Self employed and recently divorced so yes, I have had a lot of stress. Growing up, I had many episodes of strep throat then had tonsils removed at age 16. I've also had frequent UTI's my whole life and was diagnosed with IC but surprisingly, those episodes have become much more infrequent. 4 years ago and after several gall bladder attacks, I went to the ER and they removed it. I've had several \"gall bladder attacks\" since then but they weren't quite as painful and were over quickly. Senior year, I had severe pain and stiffness in my hands. I couldn't even pick up a gallon of milk Dr. gave a steroid shot and it went away. I've had a few minor episodes with this off and on over the years. My other long standing complaint would be SI pain. It started 11 years ago when I got pregnant with my one and only child. I also ride horses for a living so that could be the cause I suppose. ----------------------------------------------------------- Over the last 2.5 years my symptoms have gotten worse. My hair has been thinning badly, my skin has gone crazy with dryness and ingrown hairs, sores that take forever to heal. Bumps started showing up on the sides of my fingers. I thought they were warts and tried everything to remove them. They fluctuate in size but started getting more and more. Then they started to show up on the palmar surface of my fingers in clusters near the joint creases. Slightly larger red ones started to show up in my finger tips that were painful. Since December 2017, my symptoms have exploded. If I had to only pick one horse to bet on, it would be Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder because I have so many symptoms of multiple autoimmune diseases. Thankfully, I've been taking pictures and notes to show my doctors because my blood work is within \"normal ranges\" for everything except my low positive ANA (1:160 speckled and homogenous) so they aren't in any big hurry to figure out what is wrong with me. They are baffled by my symptoms and definitely suspect something autoimmune and are still running tests. However, I can't afford to be like this. I'm self employed! I need to figure this out and FAST. -My fatigue has gotten so bad that even my full dose of 40mg of Adderall taken all at once with 3 cups of coffee didn't even touch it.. I should've been bouncing off the walls! I feel soo tired but can't sleep more than 5-6 hours. -The brain fog is getting sooo bad. I forget what I'm saying in the middle of a sentence, almost brushed my teeth with diaper rash cream ect.. -I'm always freezing cold. I've noticed my body temp has been hovering around 97 -97.6. - My muscles ache, wasting away, getting weaker, muscle twitching is getting worse. - Burning/tingling/numbness radiates distally when pressure is applied to thin skin areas like the top of my foot/hand, inner elbow, and armpit. - More bumps popping up all over my body. - I get dizzy every time I stand up. Blood pressure and heart rate are all over the place without doing anything but sitting here. - Heart burn is getting worse and my chest has been feeling a bit heavy... -Last weekend I had a really bizarre and intense pain like my pelvis was in a vice squeezing my hips together. It lasted about 4 hours and dissipated.. it hasn't happened again yet. -I scratched a bug bite on the medial side of my bicep very lightly and it turned into a large 1.5\" hicky looking red/purple petechial bruise. Soo with that said, here are my lab results so far: High side of normal is bold. Low side of normal is underlined. Hormones: TSH - 1.06 (.40-4.50) T3- 98 (76-181) FT4- 1.4 (.8-1.8) Vit D - 32 (30-100 Normal, 20-29 Insufficiency, <20 deficient) Would you consider this low side of normal? I basically live outside, in Texas and eat/drink food fortified with it too. CBC/Metabolic: RBC- 5.10 (3.8-5.10) WBC- 7.3 (4-11) Hemoglobin- 14.9 (11.5-15.5) Hematocrit- 42.7 (34-45) MCV- 82.7 (80-100) MCH-28 (27-34) MCHC-35.3 (32-35.5) RDW- 11.4 (11-15) Glucose - 86 (70-99) Sodium - 142 (133-146) Potassium - 3.8 (3.5-5.4) Chloride- 105 (95-107) Carbon Dioxide- 29 (19-31) This went up 2 points after I QUIT smoking? Calcium- 9.9 (8.5-10.5) Went up .3 in 3 months. Protein-7.3 (6.1-8.3) Albumin-5.0 (3.5-5.2) Calc Globulin- 2.1 (1.9-3.7) (other values were in the middle) Immunology: ESR - 2 (0-20) CCP - <16 (<20) CRP - .4 (<8.0) RF - <10 (<14) ACE - 40 (9-67) Chromatin, SS A/B, Jo-1, Centromere B, Scl-70, Sm/RNP = Negative. Still waiting on results for Complement C3/C4/CH50, Histone, 14.3.3 Protein. X-rays of the hands show very mild arthritis and my SI/lumbar x-ray showed pretty significant arthritis in my right SI joint (the one that always hurts more). No other imaging done yet. ---------------------------------------------- All my symptoms scream autoimmune. However, no family history really. I had an uncle with RA and a niece with Psoriasis. All my AI labs except for the ANA are normal. My family does have a strong history of type 2 diabetes (Paternal grandma, my dad, and his 5 brothers/sisters all had it by the time they were 45. Some were skinny and some were slightly overweight). Paternal Grandpa died of a heart attack. My dad had a quadruple bypass almost 4 years ago. He's also had stage 2 Melanoma. My maternal Grandma passed away 3 years ago from breast cancer. My mom and grandma both had hysterectomies in their late 30's because of large uterine fibroids. My mom has also had a few small benign tumors removed from both her feet. Some calcified, others were not. With all that being said, I feel like maybe there is still hope that it's something else non-autoimmune and have been researching non-stop. QUESTIONS: Elevated RBC, slightly elevated and trending up Calcium, and dropping vit D, could this be parathyroid related? They haven't checked my PTH level yet. Should I even bother asking? They haven't tested other fat soluble vitamin levels but there could be a malabsorption issue after my gallbladder was removed right? I have been supplementing with vitamin D for the last week, and my symptoms haven't really improved. What's the average time it takes to see any improvement after you start supplementing? I've also been doing weekly b12 injections since March, and have been trying to drink a lot more water and haven't seen really any improvement (physically or in my labs from January to now). I was thinking that maybe it was adderall aggravated. I took only 20mg today, no caffeine, and muscle twitching happened in my left upper lip and right arm near my shoulder... both places I've never had muscle twitching before!!! The joint pain also started long before I was ever prescribed adderall. The other reason I think it could possibly be endocrine related is blue/black/greenish watery nipple discharge. Dr didn't seem concerned since it was bilateral and only when pressure is applied to the breast. She did check my prolactin level and it was normal. Any ideas or advice???? sorry for the super long post. I'm desperate!\n",
      "In May of last year, I went to a new doctor. At our first visit, when she was ordering routine labs, I asked if she could check my thyroid. I told her some of the symptoms that I was having and I started crying as I told her that my main concern was my weight. In about 2 1/2 years I had put on about 30-35lbs, all while actively trying to lose. No matter what I do I can not lose weight, and the worst part is that I keep gaining. I told her all of the diets that I have tried and she agreed that it was most likely my thyroid. She felt a nodule and ordered an ultrasound as well as the bloodwork. I felt so optimistic walking out of her office that day. A week after getting the blood work and the ultrasound, her nurse left me a message. It went something like this: \"The nodule is benign, but she wants you to get another ultrasound in 6 months. Your thyroid levels all came back normal, but she wants you to get retested in 3 months. She is concerned about the antibodies, which usually indicates an autoimmune disease. Also, your cholesterol is kind of high, so she would like for you to lose a few pounds\". :/ So fast forward a year later, and I am still trying unsuccessfully to lose weight, and in fact have put on another 10-15lbs(I am only 5 feet tall so these 45 extra pounds really show on me). A month or so ago I sent her a message and told her that I'm still having the weight issue, as well as other symptoms and I asked if there is anything else that she can check for. She basically said that she tested everything that she could and that women my age (45) tend to put on weight and have trouble losing. I feel like she just completely dismissed me. I don't understand how she can say that it definitely sounds like thyroid...she was concerned about the nodule...concerned about the antibodies...but the numbers came back and she just basically tells me that I'm old and I have to deal with it. I will post my lab results, and I understand that they are in the normal range, but I feel horrible. It's making me so depressed. My clothes don't fit. I can't even wear my wedding rings anymore. I just want someone to help me instead of just looking at numbers on a piece of paper. I know that something is not right with my body. I eat well...I exercise almost daily. I should not be steadily gaining weight. Anyway...here are my labs from May 2017 and August 2017. For some reason they either didn't do the antibodies at the August test, or it just wasn't on my patient portal thing. August 2017 labs TSH 2.600 uIU/mL 0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL Triiodothyronine (T3) 124 ng/dL 71 - 180 ng/dL T4,Free(Direct) 1.20 ng/dL 0.82 - 1.77 ng/dL May 2017 Triiodothyronine (T3) 118 ng/dL 71 - 180 ng/dL TSH 1.970 uIU/mL 0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab 33 IU/mL 0 - 34 IU/mL THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODY 29.7 IU/mL 0.0 - 0.9 IU/mL T4,Free(Direct) 1.16 ng/dL 0.82 - 1.77 ng/dL\n",

      "Hi. Im new here. I dont have health insurance and I have been going to a free clinic. I had blood work twice. The first round indicated that my TSH level was low. At 0.331. Second round was for testing of free T3 and T4 levels. Those came back within normal range, and TSH was 0.271 that time. I also had my TSI done and it just said <0.10. The thing is the nurse I am seeing doesnt know anything about thyroids. I had an ultrasound of my thyroid also. It indicated thyromegaly (moderate) and a 2mm tiny cyst with no hard masses. She just told me I have hyperthyroidism. No medication and I cant take beta blockers because low BP at 90/42. HR at 63. I also have terrible palpitations (PVCS) Im tired all the time, and also have mitral valve prolapse. So my question is could I have Graves?

      "Hello, I've not been diagnosed with a thyroid-related disorder but am here because I suspect one due to my ongoing symptoms, and I'm wondering if I can get some guidance on what to ask my doctor next. -Itching all over for the last 2 years -Feeling of harder to swallow than normal for the last 3 years -More than normal fatigue for the last 1 year (thought it was normal as I'm a 33 year old mother of twin toddlers) 6 weeks ago (a week after weaning from breastfeeding): -Sudden increase in itchiness on upper back/chest, neck and scalp -Several lymph nodes swelled up on right side, then over the weeks a few more above collarbone and other side of neck (no signs or symptoms of infection or illness) -Increase in fatigue and lack of focus/concentration 2 weeks ago: -Hair started coming out more than usual -Bald spot on top right of my head the size of a nickel Last week on Monday I went to the doctor and she did several tests for mono, cmv, abc, metabolic, etc, all negative. Did a TSH which came out normal (1.36). Sent me for a neck ultrasound, the results of which I noticed online today: -It says there is no concern about the lymph nodes although a few are more than 1cm and palpable -Thyroid gland: Right lobe: 5.3 x 1.4 x 1 cm, mildly heterogeneous, contains a 7 x 4 x 7 mm sharply circumscribed hypoechoic solid nodule, smoothly marginated, wider than tall, moderately vascular, contains single coarse echogenic shadowing focus, TI-RADS score 5/class IV. Left lobe: 4.3 x 1.3 x 1 cm, mildly heterogeneous, no focal abnormality. Isthmus: 2 mm, no focal abnormality. The doctor hasn't called me so I'm assuming it's nothing urgent, but I'm a little concerned about the nodule as I've heard TI-RADS score of 5 should be suspicious (don't worry, I will follow up with her about it). My questions are: Does a thyroid result like this during an US indicate what could be causing my symptoms? Has anyone had similar symptoms and later been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder? Could it just be hormones resettling after breastfeeding? And what should I be asking my doctor next time I go in, to rule out thyroid issues as the cause of my symptoms?

      "Heres the deal. Ive only had one doctor in my life who looked at my symptoms and said I needed to be medicated. That while my levels were \"normal\" by standards that this doesnt tell the whole story. I felt fine on a low dose of levothyroxine. Well Ive moved away from the doctor that listened to me and my current doctors tells me that I just need to eat more. I have a goiter. I have nodules on my thyroid I keep asking my doctors to do a COMPLETE panel I see now I only got T4 and TSH T4 0.98 TSH 3.07 I am 41 I quit breast feeding in November of 2017 I have ZERO sex drive.

My doctor just keeps telling me my symptoms are because I dont consume enough calories. Yet my weight is at a normal level. In fact if Im not hyper-vigilant about calories I gain. He considers my attention to calories an issue. Except if I dont maintain that I binge eat. Which is another issue unrelated that I plan to discuss with him. Am I just crazy? Do my test results warrant a second look? Ive also been diagnosed with adhd and never been medicated when I go back to the doctor Im going to ask for vyvanse.

      "So I've been scouring the internet for answers to this question, found this awesome forum and decided to join. Recently noticed my hair is thinning at my hairline and toward my center part. I'm a 32 year old female with tons of hair, so this is understandably very upsetting. I immediately went in and my PCM ran some bloodwork (most of which I requested). The two red flag items are TSH: 3.07 (lab reference range was like .5- 3.7 normal) Vitamin D: 28 (I believe the reference range was 30-something) Now, she wants to refer me to dermatology. And when I talked to the nurse earlier (somehow it is so difficult to get in touch with the PCM) she told me I'd have to discuss a different referral with the PCM because she couldn't do it. I don't even think I got a dermatology referral out of that conversation because I was making a fuss about the TSH. My main question... I guess, is the TSH level worth further investigation? Could it be the source of my hair loss? Or should I go the dermatology route first? Oh, I have had my thyroid checked in the past, some 2-3 years ago. TSH was around 1.4 or so. Thanks guys for reading and any insight.\n",
      "I had my thyroid removed when I was about 19. Don't know if they took it all out or half. Am now in my 70's. Do I still have to take thyroid medicine? Am taking Levothyroxine. The reason I ask is that I have lost so much hair. My hair is very very thin. You can see the scalp. Am wondering if it's the thyroid medicine that has caused the hair loss or it's because I don't have the thyroid gland. Have thought of going to the doctor but, thought I would ask here first. Thank you\n",
      "I repeatedly have very low TSH levels, but low to midrange free T4 and T3 levels. I have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism, not hyper, but my Dr. keeps insisting on lowering my doses of L-thyroxine and Cytomel. I am gaining significant weight and can barely function because of fatigue. My bowels would move once a week if I didn't take a laxative daily. My hair is dry and wirey, brittle, my memory is shot, I feel like a sloth trying to just move around my house and function. My current doses are L-thyroxine 88 mcg, Cytomel 15 mcg/d. I have documented hypothyroidism since 1990. Current labs on these doses: TSH: 0.018 (0.45-4.5), free T4 1.10 (0.82-1.77) and free T3 3.1 (2.0-4.4). Does anyone have any ideas why my TSH runs so low? I do have autoimmune disease, systemic lupus and RA. I have no symptoms of pituitary insufficiency, but have not been checked for that.\n",

      "Hi Everyone, I recently started getting under eye swelling out of no where. It has happened about 4 times over the past 6 months. My eyes get really watery, they become very swollen (almost like I've been punched in the eye)- mostly under my eye - and become a bit itchy. I have seen a doctor 2x and I do not have an eye infection. They keep telling me it is an allergic reaction to something. I find that hard to believe as I have not changed my make up or lotions, ect. It occurred to me that it could be related to my HYPOthyroidism. My labs were a bit off recently. I do best when my TSH is around 1 and I tend to get symptoms when it is near 2 or above and it is 2.6 right now (as well as frees being a bit off too). Have any of you experienced this and what helps? Thanks!\n",
      "I am wondering if anybody is or had a similar situation? I am a 65 year old woman. Ive been on medication for Hypothyroidism for 35 years! No other health problem other than for the last 15 years on a low dose of high blood medication (Lisinopril 10 MG) 8 month ago I became nauseous daily, unable to eat and thinking I had the flu. After a couple weeks went to the doctor because I lost 20 pounds! Began taking every test available for stomach and digestive problems. All test came back normal! I stopped taking all supplements or anything else other than my 2 daily prescriptions. After 2 months I stopped taking my thyroid medication because I couldnt think of anything else to do and I was desperate! This was against doctors advice! I stopped feeling nauseous!! After 6 month without taking medication...my thyroid test NORMAL! At this point my daily life has never been worse! I am up most of the night with spiking blood pressure and high supposedly resting heart rate. Have never been to Emergency room and ended up there last month with a panic attack with vitals 190/120/150! If I take to much blood pressure meds to get my pressure down in the middle of night, my blood pressure is dangerously low during the day. I am on a low dosage of Effexor (37.5) for panic attacts...does not help my nightly high BP or sleepless nights! I was also prescribed clonidine to immediately bring my BP down when it spikes! I finally got a referral to see an internist but the next appointment is July 3rd! Will I last that long to maybe get answers?\n",
      "I finally got the results back for my most recent bloodwork and now I'm so confused! Can anyone help me interpret these results: TSH: 0.68 (0.40-4.50 mIU/L) FT4: 0.9 (0.8-1.8 NG/DL) T3 uptake 20.8 (22.0-35%) I have so many of what I now realize are symptoms. I have been being treated for anxiety disorders, meanwhile, my levels are goofy. I have been begging for tests for so long but my PCP always just tests the TSH and says I'm \"in range\". I feel awful every day! I'm so over it! Thanks!\n",
      "I've been on hyperthyriodism treatment for nearly 1 years. At first, I recovered 20lbs from the weight that I've loss. Lately, it kept increasing so I took the gym to balance my weight. However, there's little hope cause I still remained growing weight though I developed the muscle as well. I have intention to use CLA to reduce the weight, any recommendation??? Is there any side effects or harms on the gland when using CLA? Thanks !\n",
      "I just had CBC done as part of a proactive health check through the school district that I work for. My TSH has gone up to 3.26 (still within normal range). I have felt very hypothyroid for the last 8 years. Im attaching my last post and blood work from July that has my full story and and complete list of labs. Before that my TSH was tested in Dec. and was .86. What is going on? I have never tested positive for thyroid antibodies, but was positive for autonuclear antibodies on an ANA panel. I do have a heterogenous, course in echotexture goitre that seems to be larger with each new ultrasound. One doctor thought lupus was possible, but I dont have the classic mylar rash. He retired...sigh. All others say all is normal and well. But I feel awful. I spent November to March trying to recover from a severe respiratory and sinus infection. I still run low grade fever every day 99-100. What is up!?!? What is most weird to me is that Im getting recurrent bladder/kidney infections, have extremely cloudy urine, extreme water retention, puffy eyes and face AND my latest blood work is showing that Im very slightly anaemic, and some slightly abnormal blood work with my kidneys and liver. Im just going to include the abnormal readings along with my much higher than normal TSH. TSH 3.26 mI units/mL (.34-5.00) MCHC 32.1 LOW g/dL (33-37) MPV 10.6 HIGH fL (7.4-10.4) BUN 24 HIGH mg/dL (6-20) Creatinine .67 LOW mg/dL (.7-1.20) Bili total .2 mg/dL (.3-1.2) OLD POST FROM JULY: I have had hypothyroid symptoms following the birth of my 2nd child in 2010 (so for about 7 years). I am 20 lbs over my \"normal\" weight. My hair is shedding badly. Very tired, allergies and asthma are out of control, getting chronic UTI and kidney infections, diagnosed with IBS-C, getting ready to have my 2nd sinus surgery, aches and pains etc. So far my ENT has been ordering my labs. Saw an endocrinologist once who said my levels were all normal, but wants to just retest me every year for a suspicion of Hashimotos. My goiter is \"course in echtexture\"....his only explanation for that was that my immune system was likely attacking it. I'm confused. All my Labs are normal, but with all the talk of \"optimal\" levels, does anyone see anything from these labs that could be causing my symptoms? They tell me I'm normal, but I'm always sick and tired and don't feel normal. TSH 1.84 UIU/ml.

      "Had Graves disease took Tapazole for few years till t3 t4 levels were normal then stopped tapazole and TSH went from 0.0005 to .500. Also took beta blockers for tachycardia 180 bpm but had reaction from them, called reversible hypoglycemia . It took 3 years of me going to the E.R when I felt nervous, jittery, hyper thoughts, hyperhidrosis, anxiety. The doctors never put it together that the new symptoms were caused by the new medication. Even though it's documented educational text that I came across that beta-blockers may cause reversible hypoglycemia. I also had seizures due to glucose and sodium levels going to low or non-existent . It have not felt this way in months but since the temperature went above 70 degress I got these symptoms twice within two weeks. My hdl is high but others are with in range . I hydrate and eat prior to walking. When I still had hyperthyroidism a lot of hormones were abnormal, but I noticed that when my Progesterone levels became with in range, Anxiety wasn't as bad\n",
      "Hi, Im all new to this. I recently had what my doctor thinks is a relapse remitting multiple sclerosis episode, I was sent for blood tests and due to be sent for nerve conduction studies. She wanted to test my thyroid and she tested for TSH and Serum free t4. My results are as our lab states within normal range. The TSH range of normal is 0.3-5.5. Mine is 4.7. The serum free t4 normal is 10-22. Mine is 16pmol. Im in the UK so I dont know if this sounds right or not? Can anyone enlighten me? Thanks!\n",
      "Can Hoshis be dx by an U/S alone? I have a small nodule and the report came in stating that is is highly suspicious of Hoshimotos Thyroiditis. I have almost all of the symptoms (fatigue, depression, zero libido, heavy periods, raynauds, puffy face, etc). but have not had bloodwork done in a couple of years. The blood work from a couple of years ago was normal. Do all nodules appears suspicious for Hoshis on an U/S? Thank you!\n",

I went to the dr bc I felt exhausted, I've had hand tremors, increased heart rate, sweating, mood swing, hair loss, foggy memory, itchy skin, eye pain, high blood pressure (for me), insomnia, my whole body hurts, the list could go on and on. I chocked it all up to be exhausted bc I just had a baby 3 months ago. I thought I had postpartum anxiety. It's been about month and I can't get in to see the specialist for another week. I've researched treatment and I'm not even sure what to do. I'm so confused. I'm 23 my husband is 33 and we want to have more children. We would like to get pregnant again in about 9 months so my treatment options are very limited. And I am terrified of doing the iodine radiation and the complications that could possibly come along with having my thyroid removed. :/ I would like to know everyone's opinions, pros and cons of the different treatments, and how are you doing now? If you are still reading this thank you so much!\n",
      "Hi Everyone, I'm brand new here but have been reading thyroid forums all over the internet for some time. I have kind of an interesting 'Thyroid Journey' that I thought I'd share here - mainly because my treatment is the opposite of most cases I hear about. I was started on Cytomel (Liothyronine) to treat a clinically 'mild' case of Hypothyroid, vs starting on Levothyroxine. I am recently very symptomatic and diagnosed with Hashimotio's, so now cutting Cytomel and adding Levothroxine. The question I have is that the endocrinologist prescribing the change didn't talk about titrating me down on Cytomel and onto Levo, she just cut Cytomel from 25mcg (in the morning) to 17.5mcg (over the day) and added 50mcg of Levothroxine. I was nervous about this and felt really strange the first day, but am feeling kind of immediately better these second and third days. So, just curious if anyone out there has experience or opinions on this. In my experience, starting and increasing Cytomel has an efficacy lag time of up to 6 weeks; I was wondering if this is the experience people have had with Levo as well. So, just a note on symptoms: In my experience, Cytomel is very helpful, but it can become ineffective and when out of balance or a little too much, where it creates negative symptoms. I can not believe how cloudy my thinking got just increasing from 20 to 25 mcg. It was scaring me. My sleep also changed dramatically, from comfortably waking up around 10, to not being able to sleep past dawn. And in the beginning, I wasn't able to fall asleep till 4 or 5 am. So I had a few months of just feeling wired, exhausted, on edge and anxious, and having increasing difficulty concentrating and with memory issues. Yes - these are symptoms that come with Hashimoto's, but the Cytomel really exacerbated them when it was too high of a dose for me. At a lower dose I think it has been really beneficial for me. Anyway. Recently my primary (who now left the clinic ) ran an antibody test, which showed some slight negative activity. The endo I saw a month later confirmed Hashimoto's. I've spoken to her about my symptoms at this point and this is where we are at now: cutting Cytomel, adding Levo. I have heard that starting T3 (Cytomel) can 'dump' a built up excess of (damaging) Reverse T3 at the start of therapy. I have a hunch that this is why I felt so great for the first year. But my endo told me, longer term studies in my demographic show that symptoms reverse in the short term and tend to go back to where they were in the longer term with only T3 treatment. I feel this has been true to my experience and I'm actually excited / optimistic to see what kind of stabilizing force adding some T4 might have. I welcome any thoughts or questions about all this. I know a lot of people with thyroid conditions have Dr's who will only prescribe T4.\n",
      "Hi there everybody, Sorry to trouble you all but I am getting desperate and would really appreciate some advice. I have a lot of symptoms of hyperthryoidism, although they seem to come and go in what I can only describe as 'flare ups' or bad periods. My TSH and T4 are in the normal range, but last week an ultrasound showed I had an enlarged thyroid and two non suspicious looking thyroid nodules. My boyfriend said he and his family could see I have an enlarged thyroid, but he says it was more enlarged a month ago but seems to have reduced a bit now. I have had various problems for some years now. I have been monitored by the autoimmune diseases department at the hospital because I have thrombocytopenia (low platelets) and some indicator of an autoimmune disease (not sure which one), but I have no diagnosis as yet. I was told in February the autoimmune indicator had switched off and gone dormant, but then I caught the flu and in the following month seemed to get very bad. In the past I have had a lot of problems with anxiety, mood swings and irritability. I have autism spectrum disorder and the psychiatrist at the autism centre put this down to characteristics of the autism and put me on mood stabilisers, which I came off about 6 months ago, but I now suspect this may be due to thyroid issues, as I have had all of these symptoms for years now. My anxiety and mood swings stopped about 6 months ago, but has come back somewhat over the past 6 weeks, in the sense that most of the time I feel absolutely fine, and then occasionally have a 10 minute sudden hit where I feel very very anxious for no apparent reason. It feels very bad all of a sudden and then after maybe 10 minutes just disappears. Over the past 6 weeks I've also experienced: feeling hungry a lot of the time days where I have felt very very irritated, but not often weeks of intolerance to heat feeling like I'm suffocating sometimes A years or so ago, all my symptoms were much worse and I had chronic palpitations and had various tests and minor surgery done to check my heart, which was fine. The palpitations later improved. I've had dry eyes for years. My hair is a frizzy, brittle mess. The problem that is really bothering me though is that i just can't sleep properly lately. Either I can't fall asleep at night, or I wake up after 6 or 7 hours and this is really hitting me hard, I'm just exhausted. I've tried prescription sleeping pills and melatonin but the melatonin aggravated the anxiety and the sleeping pills left me even more exhausted the next day. Many of the symptoms got very bad in the month after I caught the flu but many of them seem to have improved a lot since then, but I still can't sleep. I'm determined to find out if I have a problem but because the thyroid blood tests are normal I've been told they won't test further. I'm willing to pay for the tests privately, I just don't know which tests to do! Can anybody tell me what antibody tests I should do? Thank you!\n",
      "Hi, I have symptoms of hypothyroidism and discovered last month that I have high tpo antobodies( although only at 27 in January) Ive miscarried twice and am interested in trying nutritional And supplement avenues to help my body heal. Im reading root cause by dr. Wentz and believe I have leaky gut as well. However Im 37 and I dont feel like I can spend a year helping everything nutritionally before I try again. My functional medicine doctor told me today that it will be incredibly hard to stop synthroid after I begin, and I havent yet convinced any of my western docs to let me try Armour. I had severe headaches for three days after trying synthroid (25mcg)and severe sleepiness as well as two bouts of fluttering heart feelings. I stopped taking it after 6 days. Does anyone have experience with Armour use in pregnancy effectively dealing with the tpo antibodies? Has anyone used synthroid to help with miscarriage prevention and then been able to go back to not needing synthroid after? Thanks\n",
      "I have had a lot of weight gain the last 2=3 years and especially the last year and a half!! 20-30 pounds?! without a change in diet. Puzzled!!! I am not menopausal yet but age 46 female. I had my thyroid checked in Jan at my last physical was TSH 2.93 which I know is \"borderline\" for the newer guidelines....going to see my endrocrinologist to see if this might be why I continue to gain weight? I am even seeing a dietician since Nov due to my weight gain-and have been following a low car high protein diet since Nov-I actually think I have gained weight!!! UGGGG. Just wondering if anyone has experiences similiar?\n",
      "I posted here maybe sometime in March but I cannot find it anywhere. I tried looking for posts under my user name and everything comes up \"no results found\" so I will post it again. I am having a terrible time trying to lose weight. I was at the Dr on Thursday the 5th and he said if my test results are out of whack it will not help me lose the weight. As for the tiredness he blamed it on the 3 meds I take, I do 2 xanax at night to help me sleep, I take 1 vicodin in the morning and 1 at night to help with RA and for that wicked headache I get every now and then I was put on a muscle relaxer, but I only do half a pill because they are strong and I might do a half every 2 weeks. The headaches have really slowed down since I've been taking that script. I suffered with severe headaches not migraines for many years and only last summer my Dr decided to try the muscle relaxer. As for the Vicodin I've been on that for 15 years so my body is well adjusted all I get is relief from some of the RA pain. OK, back to the weight gain and tiredness, someone here suggested I have additional testing on my thyroid, I printed out a few pages and took them to my appt. My Dr refused saying they were no more effective in treating thyroid disorder so he only did the usual. My results were within the guild lines. So since I haven't changed my eating habits in years why did I gain so much weight? I now am going to try the Alli diet pill a try that since my daughter is also on the same mg for her under active thyroid and she lost 20 lbs using it. Here are the results of the test that was done. TSH with Free T4 if indicated Component Your Value Standard Range Flag TSH 1.97 uIU/mL 0.27 - 4.2 uIU/mL FREE T4 REFLEXIVE NOT APPLICABLE ng/dL 0.9 - 1.7 ng/dL So that's how my appointment went.

      "Hello All, I have been dealing with thyroid issues for years, but haven't ever been on a message board. However, I finally got a doctor here in Australia to listen and put me back on T3 in conjunction with my T4 therapy. I've felt like I was losing my mind and started doing some research, which led me to this forum. Background: Started experiencing hypo symptoms after the birth of my DS in 2005. Major weight gain, even though I was very active (was a mid distance dog musher, plus a mum and a high school teacher) and I ate relatively healthy. The doctors of course ran a myriad of tests and kept insisting it wasn't hypo thyroid, because my tests always came back in the \"normal\" ranges. Fast forward to 2011 when I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, had a TT which showed Hashimoto's, followed by I-131 treatment. Was put on T4 only, and kept suffering. Did the med bounce for 2 years until in 2013 I finally had a doctor try me on a combo of T3/T4 treatment. It was amazing! By 2015 I had lost most of the weight and hadn't felt healthier in my life. Then, I moved to Australia where I was told that they did not have T3. Did the med bounce again and all of my hypo symptoms came flooding back, including the weight. Just last week, I was finally able to see an Endo who listened to my symptoms and not my blood work. And guess what? Prescribed T3. I know my T4 dose was way too high (was on 175mcg). So, now I've been dropped to 125mcg of T4 and back on 5mcg of T3 twice a day. How long until I start feeling better again? I've already noticed a slight increase in energy (I don't feel like falling asleep all the time now). I've only just started the T3 a few days ago. This was my original dosage that worked for me before moving to Australia. Wondering if anyone has had changes, or did your dosages stay the same? Sorry for the long post. Am so happy to find others who understand what it's like to deal with all of these issues.\n",

      "Hello Everyone, I've been thinking about joining some forums for a while to get some feedback from people. I have a rather interesting scenario, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate/have any insights. Here's my story in a nutshell: When i was nineteen I had low thyroid hormones, about 0.03. a week after my initial test was taken, an endocrinologist tested me again and I was in normal ranges, but I still had symptoms of fatigue, hunger, thirst, increased heart rate, weak muscles. Long story short, through various alternative health means (supplements, homeopathy, exercise) I got to much more livable state of life Fast forward to now, at 25 years old. I had another major increase in symptoms about 3 years ago after drinking three weekends in a row. I went back in and my test showed me positive for Graves and Hashimoto's, and my thyroid levels were again 0.03. I was again referred to an endocrinologist, but in between my initial appointment/blood test and my endocrinologist appointment/blood test, I came upon a treatment of using canola oil on my neck where my thyroid is located. This really helped me feel a lot better, and my second test again showed my thyroid levels as normal. Over time I learned that certain foods made my symptoms worse, and long story short again, this has digressed to where if I eat certain things, I almost instantly feel pain in my thyroid and have symptoms. Right now, If I were to eat a piece of cake, my tongue would swell and hurt, and thryoid would ache for a few days, I would be so hungry 4 meals a day would hardly suffice, Tired, etc. not fun Symptoms I currently experience: Pain in thyroid, weakness of limbs (forearms and lower legs), itchy/painful inner ears, moderate insomnia, anxiety, pain in my lower row of teeth shortness of breath, slight tightness in chest, shooting nerve pain in arms and legs occasionally, swollen painful tongue Foods that trigger these symptoms: all bread, all alcohol (especially beer) sugary sweets (not fruit, except bananas), walnuts, almonds, some low quality hot dogs, pop, breading All of these foods affect me more and for a longer time period the more of them I consume. Also, when I apply castor or olive oil to my neck multiple times, it causes my thyroid to hurt for a while, and then all my symptoms improve drastically by the next morning, and after a few more applications, almost entirely gone. I have restricted myself to a diet of meat, veggies, fruit, and...potatoes, that's about it. I am currently scheduled for allergy testing in a month. Anybody else experience physical pain in their thyroid and major food sensitives?\n",

      "Hi I'm new to this forum, found it while trying to find information about hypothyroidism. From what I'm reading it's very obvious my TSH is very high but just how low is my FT4? TSH: 73.309 Ref Range: 0.350-4.940 FREE T4: 0.40 0.70-1.48 My doctor sent off for more tests which will take a bit more time to come back. She is starting me on 50mg of levothyroxine starting today. It is strange as I had TSH level checked in November and it was 0.91. I should also mention I am 6 months postpartum which is why I chalked up most of the symptoms to having a new baby....\n",
      "A week ago I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with a TSH of 128. This seems really high. My T4 Free was 0.33 and my thyroid peroxidase antibody was 3,013 (also seems really high).

Also, my gallbladder has not been functioning well for about a month and my doctors believe this is because of my low thyroid function. Anyone else seen this problem before? If so, did your gallbladder function return to normal at some point? Thanks!! Patti\n",
      "So I had begun experiencing a range of symptoms slowly over a period of time, very heavy periods, weird brain fog accompanied by a strange puffy head feeling and very poor memory (so bad my OH has to tell me things we've done years ago). Then suddenly last Oct I just put on a stone in weight, I have always been quite slim - i normally carry weight on my bum and hips, but some of it is on my tummy and the top of my hips. I developed acne, perioral dermatitis, tremendous fatigue and worsening of my already bad memory. I was also getting these weird foggy headaches (no pain, just pressure) more frequently and they left me with a bad case of the stupids for days after. I went to my doctor who has said that I have nothing to worry about, just a slightly low T3, she didn't even make any suggestions as to what may be the cause. Should I really just let this go? My symptoms are no better. The results are...

I take no HR treatment. the pain during that time resolved after few months. I do experience some necks and calf pain occasionally which resolves itself. only changes I can see are ive added more Levo and decreased D. thyroid. Used to take Levo at PM and D. thyroid in AM. As of Feb have been taking them together in the AM. Im confused with my recent physical symptoms again any insight into my situation would be so very welcomed and appreciated. Thanks\n",
      "I have been happily taking Amour for years with great results. After being diagnosed with Hashimotos, I worked for a year or two on dosages of synthetic meds and then started on Amour and bingo. I felt normal again. My story began with a sore neck which led to a doc saying I had a goiter and eventually being diagnosed by an Endo. I was also feeling like crap then. SO, I now have a sore neck again.I am also getting some of the same symptoms. I called my Endo to see if he could advise me by phone but found out he has moved. I will need to see my primary to get a referral to a new Endo. I am trying to avoid the miserable time I had going hyper before going on meds. I still take daily meds! I am also in a new state for the winter/spring which also confuses things. I would guess that I have been in great health for over 5 years. When this originally happened I was told ( in laymans terms) the pain was caused by a nodule that had broken open and released to much thyroid in my system. Does anyone have any advice for me? I dont know who to call now and I really want to avoid the misery I went through before.\n",
      "Hi all, I've been having a low grade FUO (fever of unknown origin) for about 9 weeks now, along with major fatigue and brain fog (I've been off of work the entire time). It started with a flu/upper respiratory infection that was VERY bad. I was given antibiotics which cleared up my sinus pressure/congestion, but the fever and fatigue remain... This lead to a chest/abdominal/pelvis CT scan. We didn't find anything, but a single thyroid nodule. My doctor says this isn't the cause of my symptoms, but now we have to follow up with this too. I had an ultrasound today, showing one nodule at .97cm x .8cm x .7cm. The tech commented to me that they'll probably want to biopsy it because of the large size and because there is only one nodule. I haven't heard from my doctor about it yet. I'm really scared of the biopsy. It terrifies me. I'm also frustrated because I feel like this is just a rabbit hole we're going down, meanwhile my other problematic symptoms (fever) are being ignored. My TSH and free T4 are normal, btw. The only abnormal blood work I've had in this enormous, extensive workup is a slightly elevated CRP (.4 with a normal range of 0 - .29). Tested negative twice for Lyme, mono, CMV, etc. Infectious disease consultation was fruitless. I'm supposed to see a rheumatologist for the fever, but they can't see me until March 30th. Any experiences with biopsies? I'm afraid they'll want me to do this. Can't we just monitor it for growth? I'm scared this will turn into a thyroid removal surgery, and that my fever will still remain...\n",

      "Hello everyone! I'm posting in hopes someone can give me some advice. I'm 32 years old and female if that helps any. I was given a blood test a year ago that flagged my calcium as high (10.8 and I also had one from 6 years back flagged at 10.4), but my doctor said it was fine. More recently I had a different doctor look over some of my medical info for something unrelated. He told me I needed a second opinion on my calcium. My second opinion came from a family doctor who seemed to know a surprising amount about hyperparathyroidism. He had them draw my blood (which the hospital lost and had to redo). The results just came back today with my PTH being 117, calcium 10.1 and vit d 5.5 The nurse wanted to call me in a vit d prescription but the doctor told her no and to wait until I see an endocrinologist. I'm incredibly stressed right now about the whole thing and all the endocrinologists around here have 3 month long waiting lists. Does this sound like hyperparathyroidism? What should I expect from the endocrinologist and what are some things I need to be asking them? How do I know I need to find a new endocrinologist? Are the sestimibi and ultrasound tests really as inaccurate as I am reading and if so what am I supposed to do instead? Thank you so much to anyone that replies!\n",

Ultrasound showed a lot of inflammation.

Scalp burns only at the point where Ive lost the most hair. They wont treat me with any meds because thyroid is showing that its still functioning. I have the symptoms of a problem thyroid ...from nails changing and fatigue to feeling some depression now and some weight gain.

      "Hi! So Ive never posted on any kind of boards or forums before and although Ive tried to do my own research, Im still stuck with questions. Hopefully someone will be able to help me understand myself a bit. Im 19 years old and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism when I was 16. My resting heart rate was averaging between 120-130 and I had lost a significant amount of weight. Free T4 was 7.8, free t3 was 10.2. I was seeing a pediatric endocrinologist who wobbled around could be this, could be that and within a few months of 10 mg methimazole and 25mg atenolol, I went into remission. 6 months later, my blood work showed that i was hyper again. I still went to doctors but refused to take the methimazole due to the weight gain I experienced the first time (70 pounds within 6 months). When I turned 18, i switched every doctor i had to non-pediatric. I eventually got in with an endocrine specialist who sat me down and said this is Graves disease, I am surprised you walk around without any debilitating issues and still feel alright. At any given moment if you put any extra stress on your body, your heart could fail you. I will not be your doctor if you leave my office without being put on meds and I honestly suggest you do the surgery so with a little bit of time to think, we scheduled my total thyroidectomy to happen a month later, November 20, 2017. The first two weeks following my total thyroidectomy were two of the best weeks in a really long time. I felt good, I had energy, I was happy. My family and friends said that I did a 180 turn-around and couldnt believe how much better of a person I was. I went for my two week post-op with the surgeon. Following my surgery, the surgeon prescribed me .112MG levothyroxine. The endocrine specialist gave me .125MG synthroid. The nurse at the hospital said to do what the surgeon gave me, so I had. But at my 2 week post op, the surgeon told me to start taking the .125MG synthroid and then wrote in his report to my specialist continue use of .125MG synthroid and made no notes of me ever using .112MG levothyroxine. I have been beyond irritable, cant calm myself down when Im angry, Ive had bouts of insomnia, my energy levels are so low, and Ive had my period for 15 days (super heavy which Im not used to, Im used to 3 days of a medium-light flow almost every 3 months). Ive lashed out on family and friends and been a cranky mean person all around. This isnt like me and its driving me crazy seeing the damage its doing after feeling so great the first two weeks after surgery. Can anyone please help me to understand why I am feeling the way Im feeling and what I should be doing to make this change easier? I just want to be myself again\n",
      "Hi, I have started my hypothyroid treatment journey with the help of this board three years ago. I was diagnosed as Hashi's due to elevated thyroglubin antibody and TSH 4.57. They did not test for FT3 at that time but my FT4 was 0.87 (ref. range 0.58-1.64). I had high thyroglubin antibodies for the first year, later my doctor stop ordering them. She first gave me synthetic thyroid hormone, but because I did not well with it, we changed to Armor which worked great. I move to abroad, before moving I stocked a year's worth of Armor (I cannot find it in here) and started to work with another doctor. He ordered tests twice. (The second one is a month after the first one and more extensive and conducted another lab.) My new test results showed that Test on 12/ 27 TSH 2.79 [0.30-4.00] FT3 3.90 [3.10-6.80] FT4 12.50 [12-22.00] Thyroglubin antibodies low. (suggesting No Hashi's) My doctor has increased the dosage of my medication and asked for another test. The result came back with low thyroglubin antibodies. Slightly decreased TSH (1.75 ) but also decreased FT3 and FT4 (lower than the reference range). My ferritin levels and VitD are also low. When I lived in the States, I felt myself better when my TSH was around or slightly lower than 1 and my previous doctor agreed with me. However my new doctor does not want to increase the dosage and seems a little bit concerned about the absence of antibodies (he thinks that I might not have Hashi's in the first place) and decreased FT3 and FT4 with decreased TSH. He wants me to stay on this dosage and see him again in July. However I do not feel all right (fatigued, difficulty in concentrating, gaining weight) and now I am very confused. So one more time I am asking your opinions. Why the levels of FT3 and FT4 decreased when my TSH seems to go in the right direction? I'd greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks, G. Type 2\n",

      "Hello. A few months ago I had blood tests because I was not feeling that good and my doctor told me to also test my thyroid. The results showed that my TSH was 4.3(higher than normal) and I also had low cholesterol levels( I didn't get tested for T3 and T4). After that, I did an ultrasound but my thyroid gland didn't seem swollen/looked normal. Then the doctors told me not to worry about it and that I am fine and that I should just check it again after a few months to be sure if it bothered me that much. I feel like I have a lot of Hypothyroidism's symptoms (most of them, except weight gain;it's still easy for me to lose weight). So I was wondering can I have Hypothyroidism but not gain any weight, have low cholesterol levels (apparently Hypothyroidism raises them) and have my thyroid gland looking normal? If not, then what could cause my TSH being 4,3? I will go to a doctor soon I just wanted to hear your opinion. Thanks in advance.\n",

      "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto disease a year ago. Previous to being diagnosed I became really ill with severe fatigue. I found out that I had low iron and so wasn't absorbing my thyroxine. The doctor gave me 210mg of ferrous fumerate to take daily and I started to feel better and have more energy. After I finished the iron and stopped taking it, I became tired again, so the doctor gave me some more. I have had my blood test taken again since then and although it is always within the correct levels, it is always on the low side and this is when taking the iron. I have been taking this amount for over a year, but yesterday I read that too much iron can lead to iron toxicity and give you the same symptoms as if you weren't taking any iron. The packet also said do not take longer than 6 months. I now have a lower dose packet ( 105 mg) of iron and have been taking this since January but am starting to feel tired again. I am now anxious about taking more, but worried that I might start to feel really tired again and won't be able to function properly.

      "I've been taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism for 20 years. I was stable on a dose of 112 mcg and felt great. Two years ago I finally got my free t3 and free t4 tested and my free t3 was a bit low. Under dr supervision, I lowered my levothyroxine dose to 100 mcg and added 2.5 mcg cytomel once a day. This worked for 2 years. Most recent tests (September), still felt great but my tsh dropped from .1 to .01, free t3 and free t4 at top of range. Dr told me to stop the cytomel and skip one levothyroxine a week. After 2 weeks, I had an elevated heart rate of 139 at rest for 24 hours at which point I went to the ER. They said dehydration and possible migraine and gave me fluids and pain relief. Suggested that it was overmedication of thyroid meds. Cardiologist said the same thing, still waiting for primary care appt. I took 1/2 dose (50mcg) for 1 week and am now alternating 100mcg and 50mcg until I see my Dr. It took a week of 1/2 dose to get my heart rate back to normal at moderate activity level. Finally working out again after 2 weeks off. Feeling a little hypo now, but scared to increase my dose. How long does it take to stabilize on a lower dose and is it likely I'll ever get back to my original dose? Hyper was scary, but hypo isn't great either 🤔\n",
      "Any advice or information would be much appreciated. Thank you. Three years ago, I got a super swollen neck out of no where, I got really thirsty and started peeing a lot. That was my main symptom at the time. I waited a few weeks for it to go away, but it never did. So I started seeing some doctors, they thought I had diabetes, nope, checked my thyroid hormone levels which were normal, checked for diabetes insipidus, normal. Basically I got a battery of tests all which came back 100% normal. I went to 8 doctors total assuming they'd tell me what's wrong, but they said every test they do is 100% normal and that there isn't anything they could do. I don't have the average symptoms of a hypo or hyper thyroid. I haven't gained or lost much weight, or overall felt that much different. So I gave up with doctors. THey told me they couldn't help so I lived with it. I was constantly thirsty, and had a swollen neck. I've finally decided I'm going to try to figure out what's wrong with me. Over the 3 years, I've realized that I think salt makes my throat swell and causes the symptoms. If I ever eat too much salt in the day, I swell up and don't feel well. I get a swollen neck, a headache, cloudy mind and still get an unquenchable thirst. Working out/sweating seems to help a bit. Does anyone have any similar experiences with their thyroid or parathyroid causing thirst, swollen neck when eating salty foods? Thanks for any help.\n",

I know that many people who were on Synthroid (Levothyroxine) alone & are placed on Armour have improvement. Is there anyone out there that has been on synthetic T4 & T3 and still shown improvement when switched to the natural version?\n",
      "As near as I can tell my T4 is normal but the TSH at 11.73 is high, is that correct? Doctor has not called yet so maybe they are not concerned. They switched my from Levothroyxine to the real Synthroid .50 mgs. Thanks\n",
      "Hi, i am around 40 year old. i have been hypothyroid since past 12 + years. on Synth/Levothyroxin - 120mcg and changed to 100mcp in past 6 years. Last year...i started to avoid gluten some..as i heard its related somewhat and wasnt good anyway.. after 6 mos of doing that..i did the TSH with antibody test..and antibody came out very high...so doc said to come back after 3 mos..no changes to medication since last 3 months..i have pain in bottom of feet(liek plantar fasciitis) and hands..feeling very lethargic and body pain....headaches...i feel my face is swollen...my jaws definitely feel bulkier... always had a very sensitive stomach for a long time... so did the antibody again..came out high and suddenly the hypo became hyper now..doc recommended to meet with endocrinologist...did ultrasound..and thyroid is inflamed.. she recommended one week of prednisole.....i am concerned to have steroids..but since its only for a week..should i just have it...? i just want my energy back..most of the times..i feel like i will just break down crying..are these hormones as well a fact of the thyroid issue?\n",
      "I have a strong family history of thyroid failure, and have regularly had mine tested. This year, TSH levels were over 10 in two independent tests, with normal t4. I also had brain fog, swelling, constipation, hoarseness and fatigue. No weight gain, which is unfortunate, because I always was and still am underweight. Started on 25 ug levothyroxine and felt better in less than a week. Everything improved except constipation, which is seriously bothering me, and has not improved with fiber, liquid, walking, etc. I do not have any unwanted side effects such as palpitations, sweating or weight loss. Just got my new labs tests 8 weeks into treatment, and TSH is 3.15, which is normal range (up to 4.7). Free T4 is 1.33, a little higher than before, and still within normal. I have been reading that the ideal TSH range in treatment could be lower than the normal range (lower than 2), and would like to know if any of you has any further details on this point so I can discuss with the Endo during my consultation. Could an increase in dose help me with the constipation and should I bring this up?\n",
      "New to thyroid treatment: Question about armor 15 mg I just started yesterday taking this and I had a terrible night ... palpitations and just overall didnt feel well did anyone have this experience with Armour? Just starting to take this medication, Is it something I just need to get used to? I was afraid to take it this morning but I did go ahead and take it. I contacted my doctors office but they havent got back to me yet. Im just hoping I can take it if it will help me feel better. So far I feel worse LOL any feedback would be so appreciated!\n",
      "Hi everyone this is my first post and hopefully my first steps turns real wellness So I was diagnosed with Hashimotos and Graves disease last year after a trip the ER. I was sent to an Endo and put on Methimazole ever since, my labs are tested for TSH and Free t4 and they bounce back and forth like a yoyo I see her monthly and one month theyre good the next month theyre bad. No instruction on how to assist levels other than to take my medicine. Up down on the dosage regardless of what symptoms I tell her I have. Right now im 20mgs of methimazole last month I was on 10mgs. I am also on propanothol 20mgs. Lately though I feel much more hypo than hyper. I have had extreme hair loss im not even sure how I have hair left on my head. I have also gained 40 pounds in the last six months without any changes to my diet. I dont eat great but gaining that much weight again is insane. Ive had crushing fatigue lately. Anxiety, Insomnia and mood swings, Insanely dry itchy skin to the point it almost feels like hives, Joint pain and general brain fog. I also have intense sugar and salt cravings. 8/15: Test Low Normal High Reference Range Units T4,Free(Direct) 0.90 0.82-1.77 ng/dL Tsh 1.900 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL 9/28: T4,Free(Direct) 1.14 0.82-1.77 ng/dL Tsh 2.900 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL 11/16: T4,Free(Direct) 2.15 0.82-1.77 ng/dL Tsh 0.047 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL These are the last three months of labs that my endo requested she only test for my TSH and Free T4 even though I have asked repeatedly for t3, I can put more on here if needed. I finally got the money together to order a test for my t3 and reverse t3 12/1: T3 Reverse, LC : 35 , Range 8-25 (ng/dL) T3 Free: 3.1, Range 2.3-4.2, Range 2.3-4.2 (pg/mL) T4 Free: 1.8, Range 0.8-1.8 (ng/dL) I also got my iron levels tested again since I have a history of anemia but none of the few drs I go to ever seem to want to check on it. % Saturation: 11 Range:11-50 Ferritin 118 Range 10-154 (ng/mL) Iron Binding 378 Range 250-450 (mcg/dL) Iron Total 41 Range 40-190 (mcg/dL) I plan to get my cortisol levels tested later when I have money. Though that probably wont be to til after the first of the year. I would love to go naturepath but they arent allowed to practice in our state and its too far and expensive for me to travel. I can't get any of these bullheaded drs to listen to me even when I ask specifically for the labs I want and give reason for it. Its the well I am the dr speech.... Im looking for any assistance that can be offered. I am sick of being sick. I am incredible frustrated. I dont feel currently I am getting anywhere and really feel worse. I feel my Endo and GP are just screwing around and soon im going to be bald and excessively overweight. I am tired of missing work I am afraid I am going to be fired soon. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!\n",

      "Hello all, I have a bit of a problem and need a sanity check. In early 2000s I was diagnosed with Graves disease. I had all the normal symptoms except the bulging eyes, but had one other symptom that was considered to be rare. When my sugar levels went high my potassium levels would drop like a stone and cause temporary paralysis. For several years now I have been seeing an ENDO and my meds have been stable, I take Armour 120mg 4 times a week and 150 3 times a week. And have done so for probably the last 3 or 4 years. This summer my original ENDO changed to private practice, the replacement ENDO on my first visit immediately wants to take me off the Armour and put me on LEVO and Cytomel. Why would any DR do that?

      "I'm at the end of my rope here. All my labs are \"normal\". TSH hovers between 0.5-0.6 when I feel the symptoms. I had one reading in the last few years of 0.7 when I was feeling decent. T3 and T4 are in the middle of the range. The problem is, I have all the symptoms. I've had a feeling like a lump in my throat for the last 6 months, sweaty hands and feet (but they are always cold), brain fog, difficulty concentrating, jittery, anxious, itchy and the list goes on. In addition I have probably had this a long time. I had hypertension in all 3 of my pregnancies and I had to have a hip replaced from arthritis at the age of 37. Am I way off here? The doctors think I'm crazy, quite literally. My primary wanted to send me to psychiatry to be evaluated for ADD! I keep trying to impress upon them how crappy I feel. Mood swings, crying spells etc are making me feel crazy. I finally got my doctor to order an u/s which is this week. When they find my thyroid is enlarged what is the next step? I'm just ready for some relief. Will they do any treatment after they get those results or will I have to have more testing? The only labs they did at the doctor's office this last time was the TSH. The T3 and T4 were done in Sept. How do you cope? How do you advocate for yourself? When I called the doctors office to ask for help with symptoms the response was a psych eval. I'm not crazy, this is not 6 separate issues, just do your job! How is it ethical to just leave me out here miserable for months? I really just don't know what to do now. Can anyone help? What testing do I need to ask for next? Michelle\n",
      "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in 2004. The endocrinologist forgot to treat me until 2011 since they were all concerned about my diabetes first. Just this summer, I went through two tests, 3 months apart for T4 and T3. On the first I had low/normal T4 and 0 T3. Three months later, after cutting my levothyroxine the tests came up lower/normal on T4 and 0 on T3. I have been to 2 endocrinologist's but neither doctor sees this as important, and just say my T3 is low. I feel that my pituitary is not functioning but they say I don't know what I'm talking about. They want to cut my levothyroxine even more. I have hypothyroid symptoms, have gained 40 lbs since they cut my levothyroxine for the second time in May and August, and can barely function. What do you think?\n",
      "Hi everyone! I am 25, a female. I am very very confused about what doctors say, what I read, my test results and how I have been feeling... I have been experiencing hypothyroidism symptoms for around 1-2 years, and they are getting worse as the time passes. I have been getting low-normal thyroid hormone results, but my tsh is always normal. Endo's don't prescribe me anything as low normal is normal for them even if I have symptoms. Meanwhile one of the doc's realised that I have insulin resistance (even though I exercise very well regularly) related hypoglycaemia and prescribed me metformin. I have been taking it for last 3 months. It doesn't help for anything, including weight control. The last 4 months, for the first time in my life, I have experienced irregular and missed periods. I dont have PCOS or other gyneacological problems according to my gyneacologist. But he still wanted to see my hormones. Obviously my thyroid hormones, especially T3 are lower than 2 months ago. I insisted every endo on searching my pituitary functions and possible reasons why my thyroid levels are low, I tell them what I have read on articles - but somehow doctors react agressive to such approach from the patient. I still believe the complaints I have are because of my low thyroid hormones. It may be euthyroid, less likely secondary hypothyroid, or low T3 syndrome which is not a purely thyroid disfunction problem. I have been reading a lot, believing taking my FT3,FT4,T3 and T4 to above from the mid range (to an optimal level) may help me. But I am so scared of self-medicating as all the endocs (4 famous endos in my country) were very very sure about I don't need a thyroid medication. Could you please tell me what do you think about my results? FT3 3.60 (range 3.10-6.80) FT4 13.90 (range 12.00-22.00) T3 0.75 (range 0.80-2.00) T4 6.02 (range 5.10-14.10 TSH 1.30 (range 0.30-4.00) As I said I have low thyroid function symptoms, and what I know is these hormones are optimal when they are above their midranges. I also read that if RT3 is higher than 15 (in another source it says 12) it is not a good sign. My result from around 2-3 months ago is RT3 18 (range 10-24) Please help me! I am very desperate and tired of searching this, reading articles and visiting doctors. What should I do now?\n",
      "On Monday I decided to call m doctor and ask for a FT3, FT4 and a TPO to be done. They agreed and I got those results today. The FT3 and FT4 are squarely in the normal range, which is kind of discouraging. However the TPO was 78! The reference range for that is 0-35, meaning mine is more than double the upper limit. I feel vindicated in one way, yet like I still may be in for fight. I also had an ultrasound last night which was \"normal\". I haven't seen that report yet. The good news is this along with my reports of my symptoms seem to be enough to warrant a referral to endocrinology. I'm afraid actually being seen could take a while. I think there is a shortage of endocrinologists all over the country. Or is that a local thing? Anyone have thoughts as to why I would be symptomatic and yet the only evidence supporting my claims is the TPO? Is that common?\n",
      "Hey everyone. I could really use some insight. I was finally (finally! Yay!) put on medicine about 8-9 weeks ago after trying to find a doctor to take me seriously for over a year. I had all the classic hypo symptoms and it was ruining my life. After only a few days of being on the pill (50mcg Levothyroxine), I noticed an improvement. In just two weeks or so, I was able to go up and down stairs and not get winded. Energy came back. Hair stopped falling out. I could exercise again, and could bike for 30 minutes-an hour with relative ease. I felt good again. Then, after about 6-7 weeks on the pill, it all stopped. I started gradually feeling terrible again. Now my sleep is all kinds of out of whack again. It's crazy, and I'm losing all of the energy I just gained back all over again. My doctor upped me to 100mcg, he's a fertility specialist and not an expert in thyroid, but he heard my story and was sympathetic, especially since I was unable to get pregnant and afraid to get pregnant while having these symptoms. He said if I need to go up much more, he won't be able to help me, and I'm going to have to start this process all over again. What I don't understand is that my levels were baaaaarely off. At it's worst, my TSH was 3.2 or something around there. My T4 was very slightly low, and T3 might have been very slightly not ideal. No antibodies apparently. It was a miracle anyone put me on medicine. But if I'm just subclinical, why did my body plateau on 50mcg? I'm scared I'll plateau again on 100mcg. How could I need so much medicine when I'm just barely out of whack? Does it mean it's something else?\n",
      "It just keeps getting worse and i do not know what to do.. My body cannot handle Synthroid at all.. After 3 days on 50MCG I felt like i was on coke, severe insonmia, irritability, jitters etc.. So I stop call the Dr tell him and he says stop wait 3 weeks have a blood test.. So yesterday I did just that & after 4 hours go by he calls and tells me he wants to up my dose to 75MCG.. I promptly told the Nurse the DR and I will discuss at the next visit.. But nope he still sent it over to the pharmacy.. Thankfully I managed to get the point across to the pharmacy that under no circumstances are they to fill a synthroid rx EVER for me.. I just cannot grasp why my DR who knows my body rejects this medication, still seems to want to push it. Is it time to demand a second opinion or a visit to a specialist? or is it time to fire my dr entirely.. also have any of you had a severe reaction to synthroid like I have? Words cannot describe how immensely horrible this medication makes me feel.. p.s I honestly do not feel any symptoms that one with one with hypothyroidism should without meds and NEVER have.. i do not get why he continues to push this issue. #frustrated\n",
      "I had blood work done and my ALT and AST levels are mildly elevated. Everything else is normal including GGT but the doctor is immediately blaming alcohol.

      "I had my thyroid removed because of cancer, and I'm on levothyroxine. My endo is keeping my TSH on the low side on purpose, to suppress regrowth. It was around 0.15 last test, but I feel normal (and I had Graves for many years, so I know what hyper feels like). The only weird thing is that I am waking up my husband every night by shouting in my sleep! This is new.

And despite being on Seroquel and desipramine I'm losing weight with very little effort. My last thyroid test was 2 years ago. It was perfectly normal. All previous tests have always been well within the normal range. Usually TSH tests, though sometimes there were T3 and T4 tests. I do have an enlarged thyroid but it has been that way all my life. About the time of the last test I stupidly got onto the sea salt bandwagon. I went back to regular salt around six months ago once I found out sea salt doesn't have iodine. When I was a little kid (roughly 1980) the doctor said to always use iodized salt because of the enlargement. My grandmother had thyroid problems, I think hyperthyroidism.\n",

      "Hello all. To start, I'm a 31-yr-old female. I visited my primary care physician Tuesday 11/7 for swelling on the left side of my neck and a sensation of popcorn stuck in left side of throat at the base of my tongue. Upon palpation, he found that there was considerable swelling on my left side and the same lymph node from last year is still present. (Sidenote: I had my tonsils removed last September, as they were very enlarged and I also had a painless enlarged lymph node present on the left side of my neck that was not responsive to antibiotics). I was sent immediately down the hall for an ultrasound. The ultrasonograper asked me several questions: \"Is this where you feel the swelling?\" \"How long have you felt this?\" \"Have you had any previous ultrasounds of your thyroid?\" \"If so, can you get those records to us?\" The next morning I received a phone call from my doctor's nurse saying the ultrasound showed calcified nodules in my thyroid and a high priority referral was put in to an ENT. The ENT office called to schedule an appointment yesterday morning and informed me that the doctor will fit me in over his lunch Wednesday 11/15. Normally I avoid doctors like the plague, but my mother passed away in 2015 from a second round of papillary carcinoma that metastatisized, so I know I need to follow-up.

I have no symptoms except for some weight gain, although I believe it's due to eating more and being less active.

      "Hello, I'm new here and I have a question or better yet see what you all think. I can't honestly remember when it started but a while back I noticed when I swollowed spit at a certain angle I would hear a clicking/cartilagy type sound in my throat. Only while looking down or at at downward angle. Looking down on my phone or if lying down my neck bent also to look at my phone. If I sit straight it will not do it. If I look down and turn my head it also will not do it. Also doesn't hurt to swollowing, not horse unless I'm yelling lol or doesn't do it wen swollowing food or liquids, only spit. I suffer from Hashimotos, had blood work done about a month or so ago, levels are good. I am also a hypochondriac, BAD. Well a couple days ago I went o my Dr because of my allergies and I told her about it, she said she didn't think it was anything to worry about. Felt around, and said by the way I described it she didn't think it was a nodule, if anything it's the cartilage or maybe a bit inflamed cause the nasal drip. Then she asked me if the doctor who found my hypo did an ultrasound, I said no and she asked if I wanted to do one. At the point where I am at right now with my anxiety I said no. The waiting would have me going crazy. She said okay, just wanted to do it for my peace of mind. To not worry about it. Well I am worried about it and now the scan question is driving me so crazy and anxious and stress that now I have a tightness in the throat feeling! The clicking feels upper neck, tightness feels low neck like almost to the breast bone low. Has me swallowing almost every minute to see if I can feel it, again also has my throat feeling like its closing. I've had this feeling before from anxiety too so I confused. I have also been visiting Dr Google, I know, I know but on this state I can't help it. Have anyone else felt this? Don't know why I'm even asking but should I believe her? She's my thyroid Dr. and is up on a lot about the thyroid. She's a believer in Armour and nature thyroid meds. She also specializes in other hormones. I'm freaking out guys. Dr Google tells me thyroid cancer but also tells me anxiety. Forums say the same. At the moment I can afford a scan anyways but again she said she didn't think it was anything to be concerned about. My hypochondria is telling me something else. I know the power of the mind because earlier in the year I was having bad abdominal issues. Scan, 2 ultrasounds and an endoscopy later turned out to be gastritis. But my mind had me thinking cancer. The pains and feelings did too till I found out it wasn't and wah lah no longer bothers me. Ps (edit) I do suffer from tension all around the neck area. Really bad around the shoulder blades, traps and ow in the front neck muscles too. I mean real bad knots too. Also the endoscopy was done a few months back so I would think if something was swollen or looking weird he would've pointed it out no? Lastly the tightness isn't always there. It really just started. I feel it way worse when I let it get to me and get me almost into a panic mode, I really didn't feel it till after talking to her that day, Now it comes and goes in waves, more when I try and not think about it, yea damn anxiety will do that.\n",
      "So here's my background.. Diagnosed with hypothyroidism about a year ago, prescribed 100mcg levothyroxine. About 2 months ago I had started a new diet, only protein, veggies and fruits (zero carb, zero sugar). I lost 16lbs in 5 weeks. I then stopped the diet. About a month ago, began experiencing random spells of feeling like I was going to pass out, lightheadedness and just feeling foggy. I got in touch with my primary who tested my thyroid levels and turns out they were off and she decreased me to 88mcg. This past Wednesday (5days ago), I had a severe panic attack that began with another dizzy spell. It lasted about 45 min before i got to sleep. All the next day, I was in a constant haze, feeling lightheaded all day. It was uncomfortable enough for me to leave work and see my doctor. My bp was 140/92 and my pulse was 116! She had me do bloodwork and a thyroid ultrasound. Bloodwork came back as underactive. Haven't heard back from ultrasound. For 5 days now, I've had such bad dizziness that I have just stayed home. Is this a symptom of my thyroid being off? Is it anxiety?? I can't keep going like this everyday being constantly dizzy and in almost like a dreamstate! I've also been feeling a slight pressure in my head and in my face, like sinus pressure, but I have no congestion... Please help, I'm going crazy!\n",
      "I've been on synthroid for Hashimotos for 24 years. I've done well on it overall. 22 years ago I had an episode of 24/7 overall muscle twitching mainly in my hands, feet, calves.Had MRI, saw neurologist, nothing sinister, diagnosed with benign fasiculations syndrome. Dr told me it was anxiety and I had to deal with it. I knew better. Took myself to an endocrinologist who did muscle twitching is a rare side effect but can happen. Upped my dose of synthroid. Twitches disappeared. This happened every few years and every time I started twitching he upped my dose and the twitches disappeared. He eventually sent me back to my GP for taking care of the thyroid issue since overall I do well. Have thyroid scans and bloodwork every year. So August 1st for my annual bloodwork: TSH 0.17, T4F 1.38, T3F 2.9 . At that point I felt great, no twitching. Third week of August twitching started. Called my GP and he said we couldn't up my synthroid because it was in the optimal range.... looking at the Aug 1st bloodwork. I waited two weeks and asked for new bloodwork. Sept 7 bloodwork showed changes from August 1st: TSH 1.70, T4F 1.03, T3F 2.0 . So my T3 went below normal levels and my TSH went up... trending more hypo. He still did not want to increase my synthroid but added cytomel 5mcg twice a day. Three weeks now and no change. Do I have to give the cytomel more time? Or go I ask for repeated bloodwork and ask for increase in synthroid. This twitching is driving me crazy and the synthroid increase always worked before.\n",
      "I have a lot of symptoms and I'd like to know from you guys if you think it is thyroid related. choking felling constantly difficulty breathing Phlem / food sensation in throat medicine taste in mouth feeling of tongue/ inside of mouth being thick vocal chords sting need water at all times/ dry throat feeling of water \"going downt he wrong way\" often when I drink Paiin around chin -jaw when swallowing/ Gland area TMJ and teeth shifting Starting almost 7 years ago I felt a tightness in my throat that is best described as having a finger push into your throat below the adam's apple area. It was a sensation of being choked a little bit. (Now it feels like being strangled at times) About 6 months after that I was running and breathing very hard and felt like I inhaled a bug because I had a sudden sharp felling. That began this stinging feeling that comes up for no good reason every so often. A few years after that I started getting short of breath with no explanation. Breathe tests show its not lung related. I actually had a lung biopsy about 4 years ago because the breathing was so difficult. I can breath in full and deep and still feel short of breath. At times I cant stand the seat belt even near my neck, never mind touching it. It almost feels like blood flow is being cut off and the breathing becomes harder. It seem like once a year for a few weeks I feel like that, the rest of the time the seat belt doesn't bother me at all. For the first half of each day my breathing and throat tightness and at its worse. It seems to be better after 3 or 4 pm. Nobody has any idea why that might be, but I am thinking it might be connected to when certain hormones are working and the thyroid might be inflamed more at that time. At times my mouth feels like it is swelling, when you look at it it looks normal, but I feel like the top, back of my mouth are big and its like it is going numb but it doesn't tingle. My tongue kinda feels like it is tingling at some times. I get a taste of medicine, or bug spray in my mouth sometimes. The main issue that is causing my to not be able to work, or even leave the house unless I have to, is the constant choking and the shortness of breath when it exits. A few times when I've been driving I've had the tightness in my throat like I was choking on some food and the panic and hard breathing set in right away and I wind up in the ER with a panic attack. All heart, lung, blood work etc is supposedly normal. Thyroid levels are ok CT and x- ray say this: Trachea appears deviated to the right compatible with thyroid enlargement seen on prior CT study. Docs tell me even if my thyroid was the size of a basketball it would just hang outward from the neck and cant make me fell like I'm choking. I am going to paste my Ultra sound report here: Real-time sonography of the thyroid was obtained a transverse and sagittal planes using power Doppler. Report: Findings: There is no unusual lymphadenopathy identified or thickening of the partially visualized sternocleidomastoid muscle. No retrosternal thyroid extension is noted. The right lobe of the thyroid measures 6.6 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm previously measuring 6.4 x 2.5 x 2.8 cm in dimension. The echotexture is multinodular with normal vascularity identified. There is reidentification of a large cluster of nodules seen within the mid to lower pole of the right thyroid lobe with mixed echogenicity measuring 2.7 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm previously measuring 2.8 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm. Although precise measurements are limited by the multinodular appearance this appears to be slightly small than the prior exam. Some color flow is identified with microcalcifications. The isthmus measures 0.5 cm in dimension. The left lobe measures 6.6 x 3.2 x 3.4 cm previously measuring 9.2 x 3.4 x 4.7 cm in dimension which demonstrates mild atrophy however there is a mildly hypoechoic nodule now seen within the mid to lower pole measuring 4.8 x 2.7 x 3.2 cm which was poorly seen on the prior study and a 1.9 x 1.2 x 1.4 junctional nodule with the isthmus with slight color flow.. It is markedly enlarged and replaced predominantly with multiple thyroid nodules which appear to occupy the entire gland with increased color flow. Impression: 1. Again seen is thyromegaly however there are some improvement in the enlarged left thyroid lobe seen on the prior study. Bilateral thyroid nodules as described above the largest cluster seen within the lower pole the right thyroid lobe measuring 2.7 cm with no internal vascularity slightly smaller than the prior study. Echogenic nodule seen within the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe now measuring 4.8 x 2.7 x 3.2 cm which is poorly defined on the prior examination. Junctional nodules identified within the isthmus measuring 1.9 cm which also appears more prominent on the present study.\n",

      "Has anyone ever heard of this? I've been dealing with these thyroiditis flares every 6 months or so ever since the first (most severe) one in late 2014. The first few hyper phases were the worst, and now the hyper phases aren't happening as much as the hypo phases are. I have a goiter. My thyroid is starting to fail with more consistent hypo TSH but since it keeps bouncing around from hypo to normal now every 6 months, I'm hesitant to treat it until I know what's causing it; it might be better to have it removed. My TPOAB and TSIAB are negative with slightly detectable levels. I have no detectable TGAB. My most recent TSH test was in September and it was 4.160 uIU/mL (ref: 0.36 - 3.744.160 uIU/mL) I've researched everything from antibody negative Hashi's to painful Hashi's to amyloid goiter presenting as \"subacute thyroiditis like syndrome.\" Can someone please give some insight? help?\n",

      "I switched from Synthroid to Armour 3 years ago and got my life back after wasting 22 years feeling like the walking dead. The only thing with my new treatment is that I suddenly started experiencing SAD in the fall and winter and even sometimes on dark, rainy days in the summer. The only time I have EVER experienced SAD before was when I was going through puberty and then I had it just a couple of times during a dark and cold North Dakota winter. (that was in the 60's) What I am wondering is this SAD caused by the Armour? Armour is made from pig thyroid/hormone and the reason it works so well on us humans is that pigs have almost the same hormones that us humans have. This is what I found out when I researched Armour. Is the Armour hormone affecting my hormones? This SAD stuff is really nasty stuff to deal with. I feel bad for anyone that has to deal with it. Any insight?\n",
      "Hi everybody, Lately i suspect to have hyperthyroidism. I experience: - weight loss - brain fog - fast heart beat - bad sleep For the past 3 months I've been supplementing these daily: - collagen (to gain weight) - msm (for skin) - magnesium (regular bowel movements) - l glutamine (gut healing - energy) - alcar (neuro defense) I'm sure the cause is in these supplements. From my research, ALCAR is fine. I found some bad relations between collagen and hyper-T instead. Not much about the others supplements. Id like to spot them and remove them from tomorrow. THANKS A TON\n",

      "Just got a new prescription for my thyroid by Erfa. Pharmacy told me they won't be carrying that anymore the company has discontinued it. I asked her what other NDT meds are on the market in Ontario she had no idea! what the heck am I suppose to take now??\n",
      "Hi, everyone. I've been on Levothyroxine & Liothyronine (generic Cytomel (T3)) since Oct. 2013. For the longest time, I didn't seem to have any issues with either med. Over the past year, I've been noting that I have HORRIBLE pitting edema, especially in my lower legs, and it just kept getting worse & worse & worse! My doc didn't seem too upset or impressed by it but it bothers me greatly. Not only do I have so much swelling that my socks cut into my legs all day, but it's actually making my legs HURT. Since my doc didn't seem to want to help, I took it upon myself to \"play around\" with my meds. I stopped the T3 for a time and it didn't make any difference in the swelling. Started back on both for several weeks and then I stopped taking the Levothyroxine. It didn't take but 3 or 4 days without the Levo & I started seeing a daily reduction in the swelling I was having. I've been without the Levo and taking JUST the T3 for about 2 months now and I have absolutely NO swelling. Trouble is, I'm thinking the T3-only regimen is now not enough med for me because I've been noting the return of some of my symptoms. Has anyone else experienced swelling when taking Levothyroxine? Why would I suddenly start having this problem after so many years? Is it possible to get proper thyroid management on T3 alone?\n",

      "Having found a hard kind of a swelling near my thyroid gland about 6 weeks ago, I saw my GP and was sent for an ultrasound scan, the results came back last week Headed as \"Abnormal\" and read as follows: Within the left lobe of the thyroid there is a 20 mm x 13 mm x 12 mm nodule. The nodule is hyperechoic, spongiform in echotexture and demonstrates some internal vascularity. The nodule also appears to be taller than wide. This nodule would be classified as a U3 - indeterminate. FNA may be considered. Some smaller nodules also noted in the left lobe of the thyroid. Normal ultrasound appearance of both submandibular and parotid glands. No evidence of any lymphadenopathy. Conclusion: U3 classification nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid. A couple of my blood results worried me aswell... my ESR is 39, (My GP said it is a sign of something going on, but is non specific, so no more to be done with that..) my TSH level had gone up from 2.7 to 5 in 6 weeks... (I am already on Levothyroxine due to an underactive thyroid, and my meds have been increased from 50mcg to 75mcg for now). My GP is referring me to an Endrocrinologist, and I have an appointment for that in 4 weeks time, she doesn't feel I need to be seen sooner... but I am a little concerned about the size/shape etc of the nodule, can't lie... I just wondered, what anyone else thought about it really... Should I be asking to be seen sooner.. I am worried, only as I have nothing to compare this scan with, I have no idea, how quickly this nodule has been growing, whether it was originally the size of the other nodules that have been noted etc...\n",
      "Hi everyone, I was here many moons ago and this board helped me keep my sanity during a very dark time in my life. Now i'm here to discuss my 18 year old daughter. She's had health issues for years now. Allergies landed her in the ER a couple times with asthma attacks, so she began getting allergy shots. Diagnosed with ADD in middle school, followed by anxiety & depression. Meds have helped on both accounts. In highschool she started fainting. Dr. discovered she had a high heart rate and a trip to the cardiologist diagnosed her with issues with her autonomic nervous system. Trying to stay hydrated and increasing sodium helped. Also discovered her TSH was a bit high. A trip to a pediatric endocrinologist was not helpful. He told me he does not treat teens with hypo as they often revert back to normal and chastised me for taking Cytomel with my Synthroid. I should have sought a different dr then but she goes in spurts where she seems better and I don't want to mess up a good thing. Senior year of highschool was rough. Mono and multiple bouts of strep throat led to tonsillectomy. Then she had an ovarian cyst rupture and she needed emergency surgery as the dr said there was too much blood/fluid in her abdomen for her to absorb naturally. I know the kid is already on the autoimmune train as she has inheirited Raynaud's from her grandmother. I've recently taken her to a new physician as she has aged out of the pediatric world and wanted to see where her thyroid numbers were at now in addition to get her established as a patient. Her TSH has come back slightly elevated at 4.1. I did not speak to the physician (since she is 18 now) but it does not sound like she wants to treat this now. My first reaction was that is not TOO high maybe we should wait a bit longer. But I seriously thought I was gonna die when my TSH hit 7.1, and I'd rather her not go through all that. She is currently taken meds for ADD, anxiety, and birthcontrol pills so I hate to add to that as she is BAD at taking pills when she is supposed to, but I think it would help her. Where is that damn thyroid patch when you need it? My question is this: Do you all think it is time for me to advocate for treatment for her? Thanks for your help!\n",
      "Hi, everyone! This is my first time posting and I am looking for your opinions! I am 26 years old and pretty healthy, however I have had some recent issues. For the past two years I have been dealing with muscle/joint pain and fatigue but it I have just dealt with it and never mentioned it to my doctor. Well, for the past 6-8 months I have developed horrible anxiety which I did talk to my doctor about. She took labs and found that my thyroid levels weren't normal. There were as follows: T4= 13.6, T3 uptake= 17, Free Thryoxine= 2.3 (normal), and TSH= 6.23. She referred me to an endocrinologist. A month later I finally get an appointment with the endocrinologist. Based on my previous labs, she said I have hypothryoidism... and that made sense! But she wouldn't but me on meds till they took more labs. My second round of lab results were as follows: TSH 3.130 Triiodothyronine,Free,Serum 3.0 Thyroxine (T4) Free, Direct, 1.34 Thyrotropin Receptor Ab, Serum 0.88 Thyroid Stim Immunoglobulin 43 (%) Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab 10 Thyroglobulin Antibody <1.0 (IU/mL) ALL NORMAL! So the endocrinologist said nothing is wrong with my thyroid and sent me on my way. As far as my anxiety is concerned, she told me to see a therapist. I told her about the muscle/joint pain and fatigue but she didn't seem to care.. just said nothing's wrong. Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this???? Could it be hypothryoidism?? Or am I dealing with something like Lyme disease or fibromyalgia? Any thoughts are appreciated\n",

      "Hello everyone, Can someone please help me interpret blood work results? I am in the process of searching for a new endocrinologist and in the meantime am finding myself in deep desperation due to my symptoms. Thyrotropin Receptor Ab, Serum - <0.50, range 0.00-1.75 Thyroid Stim Immunoglobin, 39%, range 0-139 Triiodothyronine t3, 126, range 71-180 Thyroid Peroxidase tpo Ab, High 127, range 0-34. T4 was not tested, I don't know why. I also have two nodules, one is bigger than 1.2cm and was biopsied, but I have not received the result yet. I have a variety of symptoms that have led me visit with a psychiatrist, neurologist, rheumatologist, and have done too many tests and workups to count and the doctors cannot find anything wrong with me other than the above. I've been tested for all autoimmune diseases, more than once, and was given a clean bill of health each time. Lyme, Lupus, MS, ALS, Rheumatoid Arthitis, Sjogren's Syndrome, you name it, I've been tested. My symptoms are insomnia (1.5 years), depression, anxiety (what feels like hyperactivity), muscle weakness, muscle fatigue, chronic fatigue, bone/joint pain, shortness of breath, twitches all over my body, including face and tongue, irritable bowel disease (had a colonoscopy and endoscopy performed in 2017), major brain fog, irritability, jumbled works, as though I cannot pronounce words, bottom of feet hurt, interstitial cystitis (onset, 1 year ago, soon after the insomnia). The kicker is that symptoms get better, but never disappear, and then worsen. I notice the symptoms are \"stronger\" two weeks before my menstrual cycle, better a few days after my cycle ends, and worsen one week after my cycle ends.In essence, it feels my body somewhat normalizes for one week and then goes into hyperactive/reactive mode. Gynecologist refuses to test my progesterone and testosterone and so did my endocrinologist, both stating such hormones are irrelevant. I had my first child 3 years ago and 1.5 years after his birth I began experiencing the symptoms. Honestly, the most difficult symptoms of all is the insomnia and fatigue. I feel crippled due to constantly feeling sleep deprived and tired. Sleep medications barely work and Xanax is what gets me to sleep for a few hours. I don't want to take Xanax, but I don't have a choice. If there is someone on here from anywhere in New Jersey or New York who has an endocrinologist that listens to the symptoms and wants to help, please share! I'm desperate. Any feedback or help is greatly appreciated! Thank you.\n",
      "I have been battling thyroid disorder, very large, very visible multi-nodular goiter for many years. My thyroid continues to grow (although very slow and slightly) and I experience periods of time (days, weeks ) of fullness in my neck that frighten me. I have had MANY ultrasounds and biopsies and a nuclear scan. No signs of cancer - just a huge thyroid that worries me as, after 30+ years of treating it, I can now feel it heavy and full at times. It makes me both uncomfortable and anxious during these spells. Anyways, my family doctor and my ob/gyn are both encouraging me to remove it - just by the looks of it alone because it IS big and very noticeable. My endocrinologist does not want to remove it unless it 1) is cancerous (which it's not) or 2) causes serious constriction or blocking (is not serious but is at times uncomfortable). After so many years though and now with the feeling of fullness and heaviness, I am thinking I may need to just push the issue to have it removed. My grandmother (who is no longer living) had her vocal cords permanently paralyzed in her thyroidectomy surgery, so I do have fears about the possible consequences of surgery especially on a thyroid as large as mine. I would like to know from those of you who have had your thyroids removed what it has been like. Do you have improved symptoms? Does the lack of a thyroid cause other problems for you? Do you feel it was worth it? Thank you for any information on \"the other side\" of living without a thyroid.\n",

      "Hi all! I am new here and this is my first post. I think this will be kind of long but i'll try and keep it simple as I can! About Myself: 22 year old female 98 lbs, 5'1\" height generally not very active beyond normal daily activities (trying to change that though) So last November I got a physical for the first time in forever and had mentioned some things to the doctor (that I used to feel faint a lot when on walks - never actually fainted, but would have vision starting to blacken and not able to walk straight, and also orthostatic hypotension) which he thought possibly could be a thyroid issue so along with the normal blood tests for the physical he had my TSH and Free T4 tested as well. My TSH came back as 4.68 reference being 0.450 - 4.500 so slightly above reference. Free T4 was 1.18 reference being 0.82 - 1.77 so pretty decent it seems. However after he had mentioned thyroid at the appointment I tried to learn more about it and found that many of the professional organizations really define optimal TSH as being below about 2.5 or 3.0 so then I got to thinking maybe I DO have a mild thyroid problem. Some other symptoms I have fatigue - many days I really don't feel like doing much of anything even though in my head there are many things I wish to get done, last summer there was a few weeks whee I absolutely did not want to get up despite sleeping many hours. I wasn't sure if my sleep was just very poor for some reason those weeks, or if I was sort of depressed or what but it was so strange. Also lately have been forgetting things so easily, like if I think of something I wanted to say to my mom and I go to her a minute later and have already forgotten what I wanted to say (not sure if that type of thing can be thyroid related or not). I get cold pretty easily too, my parents like to keep the thermostat at 68 or so and I often wear a hoodie around the house. Also, my LDL cholesterol at that physical was a little high (139, reference being below 100) which I understand can be associated with hypothyroidism, granted my diet is also not the greatest (trying to gradually work on that as well). All other blood lipids were normal, blood counts normal, vitamin D low (not a surprise to me though). The last thing which occurred about a month ago (Sept 7th) I woke up to the room SPINNING which was momentarily terrifying. I went to the urgent care the next day and they did flush my ears out as there was soo much wax, and there was excess fluid in my ear which would have caused the balance problems. The Dr. said it was congestion from allergies even though I didn't really have other allergy symptoms and told me to take allergy meds. After 10 days I finally felt normal EXCEPT when laying down which I STILL do not feel normal if I lay my head too flat. This particular issue could very well not be thyroid related at all but thought I'd include it just in case anyone has had this type of experience too. I intend to go to another Dr within the next month or two and have them check my thyroid levels again to see where it's currently at if it's lower, higher, or what. In the mean time I'm just curious if anyone could weigh in if they've had any similar experiences or if they've had similar numbers to mine and what type of symptoms you've had.\n",
      "Hi everyone! I'm new to posting and looking for some help from those who have dealt with thyroid problems and the tough journey of being diagnosed. I was diagnosed with stage IVa subglottic squamous cell carcinoma at 31 years old in 2014. I was treated with CIsplatin and 35 rounds of radiation directly to the throat. On the Head and Neck Cancer groups that I'm a member of, many complain of thyroid issues due to radiation and the difficulty in getting \"diagnosed\". I requested my radiation oncologist order labs on my most recent checkup which was two weeks ago and this was the outcome: T3 2.9 pg/mL Reference Range:2.8 pg/mL - 4.4 pg/mL S-TSH 1.48 mIU/L Reference Range:0.30 mIU/L - 4.20 mIU/L T4 Free 0.9 ng/dL Reference Range:0.9 ng/dL - 1.7 ng/dL Rad Onc says I'm normal, but T3/T4 seem at the lowest end of normal if I'm interpreting correctly. Symptoms are extreme sluggishness (I hesitate to call it fatigue after experiencing fatigue during chemo/radiation because it's a different beast), terrible forgetfulness, anxiety, depression, low libido, muscle cramping, consistent cold feeling, bowel issues (sporadic),hoarseness (which I usually attribute to cancer side effects but has gotten markedly worse since February of this year...over two years post-treatment), sleep issues, infertility symptoms and, of course, weight gain. Since diagnosis and beginning treatment, I've gained 35 pounds. No change to exercise or diet that would've precipitated that. I know this is long, and perhaps the thyroid isn't the issue at all, but thought I would start here to get feedback from all of you who have probably walked this journey before me. Any help would be so appreciated! After being a living science experiment these past three years, I just desperately want to feel normal. Thanks everyone!!\n",
      "I recently was informed by doctor that I have vitamin d diffiency and I have been experiencing many hypo symptoms. I have never weighed more then 120 recently over the last few months have gained 29 lbs. Before anybody ask my appetite varies from eating very little to eating a lot every few weeks or so. I have depression, anxiety, brain fog/forgetfulness, blurry vision, vertigo among other symptoms . Could this possibly be hypothyroid?\n",

      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "Hello, I recently had a blood test done and found out my TSH level is at 5.09 mIU/L. I am a 20 Year old Male, I weigh 190 pounds and I am 6'2. I exercise 4-5 times a week doing cardio/strength training. I watch what I eat and am sure to have a balanced diet. I take a High End Multivitamin), Concentrated Fruits and Vegetables, Omega 3, etc. I also have been on 20mg Amphetamine Salts (Adderall) for over 5 years due to ADHD. My HDL was at 48, a bit lower than I want but everything else was good. I used to be overweight when I was younger until 15 years old. I have smoked/drank when I was 15-19 but I have completely stopped for the past year. My family has had a plethora of Thyroid issues, my mother got hers removed. I work in a sales at a call center and I am on the phone 5 days a week for at least 4-5 hours. I try to maintain my voice by using cough drops. Recently my left eye has felt a thumping every few hours, almost like a heart beat, very light but seems to be getting more mild. I sleep 4-5 hours every night, and wake up early to workout. If there is any suggestions, advice, explanations, I would be very open to hear. I am scheduled for a 2nd test 1 month from this one. Thank you so much in advance.\n",
      "Hi everyone, Hope I can get some insight as to what I've been suffering from for over the past year. I'm a 39 yr old female and I have a pretty extensive medical history with a few surgeries, a history of chronic pain that has recently improved some. Partly because I decided to stop all of my medications for pain a few months back. But these symptoms begin prior to stopping. Part of the reason why I did was because my cognitive functioning and brain fog became so severe that I no longer wanted to make it even worse with sedating drugs. Plus I've just become rather discouraged and fed up with doctors and some of the poisons they seen to want to push instead of finding root causes of symptoms. Angrier at myself for taking them and making myself sicker, esp over the last couple years. At first I immediately suspected either Adrenal Fatigue or a Thyroid issue. I did a two week taper of prednisone earlier this year and it made me incredibly sick and made every single symptom I was already having worse. I'm pretty sure I should have went to the hospital but I decided to ride it out at in bed for a while. I could barely move at all and had pain in places I never had before. I was also a complete sleep deprived, angry zombie. Some of those symptoms never went away and continue to impede any quality of life I wish to have now after suffering for so long. It took me months to get in to see an Endo which I finally did last month. I was very disappointed. I thought for sure my symptoms matched up to this being a Thyroid issue but she keeps insisting my lab results are fine. Now I've been full of anxiety and worry that it could be something else, a few possibilities that have come up are Lyme, Leaky Gut, Candida, Sleep Apnea, Bio toxins, Other Hormonal Imbalance, etc. I'm in the process of currently getting tested for all of the above but so far these doctors don't seem to be listening to me. I don't know much about Thyroid Disorders except that to me, my results look to be in the lower normal range. I could be wrong and I'm hoping to get some opinions on here about that. The only medications I have been taking are Lisinopril and Atenolol both for high blood pressure and I very recently have stopped the Atenolol to see of maybe it was the cause of some of my symptoms on the recommendation of the Endo but the symptoms remain. Here are some of them. There's way too many to list all: *Chronic severe insomnia. Waking up numerous times a night not being able to get back to sleep. Sometimes with pounding heart. Racing mind. *Severe brain fog, confusion, memory issues, loss of focus. Feeling detached and just out of it. Not myself. *Rapid loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. Find several every single day. One eyebrow in particular has last 1/3rd missing and patches now missing in first 1/3rd. Hair on head thinning in front. Always had very thick full head of hair. *Brown (Melesma) and White splotches on face. Always had nice even skin before all of this. No more. *Keratosis Pilaris ( Tiny bumps) on arms and now spreading to face. Again, never had this before in my life. *Increased acne, esp before menstrual cycle. *Very scary heart palpitations * Blurred vision that comes and goes. Along with the brain fog and memory issues, all of these combined scare me a great deal. *Occasional sore throats that come and go. *Random muscle pain and tightness in different areas of body. Sometimes shooting pains in joints that come and go. *Facial swelling *Decreased appetite/ loss of weight. This is after the last couple years where I actually gained quite a bit of weight pretty quickly. Blamed it on other factors at the time though. * Strange metallic like or sour taste in mouth *Fatigued but can never rest or sleep *Occasional darkening under eyes and bags *Acne on scalp *Ringing in ears and fluttering sounds *Increased GERD and digestive issues *Anxiety and depression (Mostly about symptoms and not ever feeling \"there\" with my brain and the hair loss frustrates and scars me too) Feeling like I'm losing my mind everyday. So those are some of the main symptoms. There's more of course. If anyone has any questions I'd be glad to answer. It's just all too much to type here and I know I'm already writing a novel as it is. Here are my Thyroid lab results: TPA 1 (<9 IU/ML) Cortisol Total 15.2 DHEA Sulfate 166 ( 23 ~ 266) T4 Free: 1.2 (0.8 - 1.8) TSH: 0.88 (0.40 - 4.50) T3 Free: 2.8 (2.3 - 4.2) Also very high Cholesterol, HDL, LDL and Non HDL , all high. This after I changed my diet completely and lost almost 30lbs in a few months. Endo says it's hereditary but I know it can also be a sign of Thyroid problems. Also worth mentioning is that up until a year ago, I was taking an anti anxiety medication, that has been known to cause Thyroid disorders as a side effect. Of course they claim they number is small but there seems to be plenty of people online claiming it caused these problems for them. I was on it for about 8 years when it seemed to lose it's effectiveness almost overnight and it's been hell since with both the above symptoms and then all hell really breaking lose with the Prednisone about 5 months later. I haven't been the same at all. Can anyone help shed some light on this for me? I feel like the Endo I've been seeing is just one of those that look at lab results. She's very old school and I've decided to fire her but I really don't know where else to go with this. I keep going from specialist to specialist for all these different issues like dermatologist and allergists, Rheumos, etc. They all say it sounds like Thyroid but then I tell them Endo says I'm in range and they have no other suggestions. I'm tired, scared and frustrated and I'm unable to do anything in my current state. Work, live, etc. Am I wrong in thinking those results look a little low? I've heard some people need to be more in the middle and high ranges to feel better again. Unfortunately, I live in an area where a good specialist is hard to come by, esp an Endo. I'd pretty much be playing the lottery with another and would take at least another 4 to 5 months to get another appt for a 2ND opinion. I really don't know how much longer I can feel like this. Not to mention some days I wonder how much longer my heart will last with all these skips and thumps. I do have an appt with a hormone specialist in a couple weeks to go over more results I just had done. He also tested TSH, T4 AND T3 among other things but don't know how he will interpret these results either. No one seems to be listening to how this is ruining my life. Just looking at the blood work. Can anyone give their opinion on this or advice? Maybe I have been wrong the whole time in thinking this is Thyroid. One of my theories is that my thyroid or adrenal function changed either while I was on or going off the anxiety med and then the prednisone and my system just crashed after that? There's just too many factors in my case unfortunately and other possible things it could be. But I don't feel like I can trust this Endos interpretation of all of this. I'm sure if anyone reads this far they will know more then I do. I honestly feel like I'm dying some days. The symptoms scare me so much and I'm all on my own with this. I've spent every cent I have on trying to get answers and so far it's gotten me no where. I know that a functional med doc or naturopath might be of some help but again, there's not many where I live and at this point, I haven't been able to work and can't afford to see one. Most don't take insurance. At least the ones in my area don't. I want to thank anyone who has read this whole thing from the bottom of my heart. And thanks in advance to anyone who responds with any helpful information. I really need to be healthy to be able to go back to work and support myself. This is killing me inside and out. Also hope this is coherent enough to read. The brain fog is horrible and scary. Mergirl\n",
      "Hello everyone, I am losing it with my GP and the system here and would like your help. In May I had a routine blood test in Greece which showed that I have Hashimoto antibodies and TSH of 5.42. They told me I need to take T4 levothyroxine. I start taking it for a few days, I come to England (where I live) and I tell my GP about it, she says that I need to repeat the test here, I have a blood test here, apparently comes up completely normal (I dont know if they checked for Hashimoto antibodies), they tell me I do not need to take any medication. I explain to the GP that I have already taken some days of T4 levothyroxine, she says maybe it came up normal because I took it for a few days - I need to stop taking medication for 3 months and then repeat the test. I did as she said. I wait for three months, they repeat the test in England and they find the antibodies for Hashimotos (probably did not check before) and something like a 2.5 TSH. I have a feeling that the UK test is not as sensitive as my levels in Greece have been 4.5 and 5.5 and in the Uk they have been 2.5.? In the meantime, right after that test, I fly to Greece, where I see an endocrinologist, and he performs another blood test and an an Ultra sound, during which he finds a nodule in my right lobe. He tells me I need to take t4 75mm levothyroxine. I quote his report: 'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto). In the right thyroid lobe, exists nodule 6,0mm, with intensive blood circulation in the interior. In the left thyroid lobe, nodular alteration 13,4x10,3x18,0mm, that happens because of the chronic alterations due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The results of the blood tests are: TSH (16.05.17) 5.42 μUI/ml (high) and again (06.09.17) 4.52μUI/ml (high). FT4 (06.09.17) 10.4 (in the lower levels). antiTPO (+) It is necessary to prescribe medication, hormone replacement with L-thyroxine 75μg daily. After 3 months it is necessary to repeat blood test for measuring TSH, FT4 and after 6 months to repeat ultrasound in the thyroid.' To top it all off, he tells me that the FSH/LH/E2 blood results show that I am in Early Menopause (!!), and I am 37 without a family which has shocked me as I will need to think seriously about all this. I come back to London, I show my GP these results, she tells me she will email the endocrinologist about all this, and apparently the endocrinologist has replied that, I do not need to be on medication, the results are in normal range, Hashimoto's does not mean that I need medication, it means I need to observe it, and that I do not need medication 'except if she's trying to get pregnant'. What does that mean? I ask. Why do I not need medication unless I am trying to get pregnant? What difference does this make? She says something like 'yes we recommend it only if you are trying for a baby'. What about the FSH results that show that I am in Early Menopause? Can I maybe have a referral to see the Endocrinologist? No, there is no need, as he is happily responding with email. What about the nodule? I ask. The GP says 'it shouldn't be a problem, but we will repeat the Ultra sound here to see if there is anything' (I told them I can give them pictures of the Ultrasound in Greece but something about it needing it to be in their system - fine - I'll go for another US) Now I am asking you, dear community, what do you think about all that? I am so confused. What is happening? I need to know my rights - can I not have a referral to the Endocrinologist? Do I have to go through the GP? Any advice would be appreciated. Best aat021\n",
      "Hi, I am new to the board. I was recently prescribed synthroid. I take a half of a 25 mg tablet once a day. I have a nodule on my thyroid but normal levels.

      "Hi guys! So, I have read the message boards for a long time now, but this is the first time becoming a member. I've suffered from Hypothyroid-like symptoms for seven years now. I recently had an episode of Hyperthyroid-like symptoms, and I was suspecting Hashimoto's so I got my TPO antibodies done again. They were at 11. Lab range only flags it if it is above 34, but recent updates usually flag it if it is above nine. That plus my Hypothyroid symptoms (literally, about two pages long! ): ) With my normal iron and high ferratin levels and elevated white blood cells (while feeling normal), I suspected that I have inflammation. My doctor prescribed a 5-day-pack of Medrol for inflammation, and I've never felt better! of course, it was only five days.../: But, I've read that having slightly elevated TPO antibodies may not mean it's actually from Hashimoto's - that it could be another autoimmune disease, like lupus. So, I'm wondering. Have any of you heard this? My symptoms seem to match with Hashimoto's the most, but then again there's over 100 autoimmune diseases. And I wonder if it's possible that I don't have an autoimmune disease (hopefully). I've noticed that when I exercised, my symptoms flare up, and I also get sick really easily. I get ear infections, colds, the flu, bronchitis, etc all the time, and it lasts two weeks, one month (usually), or even longer than two months. Any thoughts? Really lost here. ): I've had these symptoms for seven years that's been adding up more and more. I'm also 19 years old, was active and in sports all my life, and even though I used to eat like crap - my diet is somewhat better now. It's not perfectly clean, but I do try to avoid a lot of processed foods, etc. Edit: I should also mention that my TSH, Free t4, t3 were all NORMAL. Except my reverse t3 was high.\n",
      "Hello. I have been through many threads on this forum and have learned a lot of good information. You all seem very helpful. I am a 19 year old female. I am being treated for hypothyroidism most likely due to a previous period of prolonged, severe anorexia. There were some days when I only ate an apple. During this period, my hunger pangs died off, my GI system came to almost a dead halt, and I grew very ill and was no longer able to play sports like I used to. When my mom finally realized what was happening, she forced me to start eating again--but I believe it was too late. She was convinced that my symptoms would dissipate once I started eating normally again, but it has been five years and I still experience zero hunger pangs, little GI movement (I'm dependent on myralax at this point), almost constant weight gain even though I only try to eat a 1,200-1,400 calorie diet daily, little tolerance for exercise (I get exhausted and out of breath easily, especially during hikes for some reason), extreme fatigue (to the point where I sometimes have to pull over when I am driving and rest a moment), and a serious inability to concentrate. Additionally, I have a body temperature of about 97.2 degrees most days, I am unable to adapt to temperature change and get hypo/hyperthermic easily, I lose hair by the handfuls, and I have a terrible immune system. I don't have my results with me, but my cortisol levels are normal, my TSH is normal, T4 is normal, T3 is low, and RT3 is high. I have no thyroid disorders and my issues would be classified as NTIS. I've been trying to read as much as I can about all of these results and I've come to determine that this all must have been brought on due to my bout of anorexia. I have read that periods of starvation can cause your body to go into a stress mode where most T4 is converted into RT3, levels of which contribute to hypothyroid symptoms. With that being said, I believe that the source of the problem at this point must really just be the low T3, high RT3 levels in my body. I am predicting that as long as I eat right and work to increase T3/decrease RT3 hopefully my metabolism will get up and functioning again. That's my end goal at this point. I have low ferritin levels and I am taking 30 mg/daily to hopefully raise those. Otherwise, nothing is abnormal in my body except for the T3/RT3. I am seeing a doctor who does not know too much about NTIS (who does, though?), however he was kind enough to allow me to try Cytomel as an attempt to directly raise T3 levels and see what difference that makes. Three days ago I began taking 20 mcg, 10 mcg 2x a day. I haven't had any negative side effects from it. In fact, it feels like I'm not taking anything at all except for the fact that I actually feel a slight boost of energy from it 1 hr after taking it until probably 2-3 hours later. For the first time in months, I was able to get up and go to the gym to do some light jogging yesterday! I'm still tired, but I'm functional. Even if this is all cytomel will ever do for me, I appreciate even this. Nevertheless, I was wondering if any of you guys who have also taken cytomel experienced an increase in GI function/metabolism? Other than the sheer exhaustion, getting those things back are my biggest concerns right now. I have read from others' posts that it takes a while for things to start improving, but I wondered if anyone has gotten their GI function/appetite back in particular? If so, were there certain foods you ate or exercises you did in tandem to help bring it back? I was also wondering what the significance of serum T3 levels is compared to bodily T3 levels. One of the threads I was reading was saying that although it's short-lived in your body, it takes maybe a month or two to build up that serum T3 level. What's the difference and how does the serum T3 level affect everything vs the bodily level? Oh, and one last question. How do you guys know you are at a good dosage? Do you just go up one dosage too high, experience negative effects, and come back down, or what? Sorry for the long post and thank you for all your help!!\n",

      "Hi. New to the board here. I'd like to ask your opinion about my new prescription. First, I've been taking thyroid meds since January. Started with levothyroxine and switched to NatureThroid a couple of months ago. I have been taking 1 gr, or 65mg NatureThroid for approx 8 weeks. Yesterday I had labs done, and the results came back today. They were: TSH = 4.38 (0.45 - 4.5) FT4 = 0.74 (0.82 - 1.77) FT3 = 2.7 (2.0 - 4.4) So, my TSH is at the high end of the range, and my FT4 is a little below normal. A little increase is in order. The strange thing to me is that rather than changing me from 1gr to 1.25 daily, he said to continue taking 1 gr 5 days a week and 1.5 gr on 2 days a week. Nature Throid does make a 1.25 gr tablet. I'd rather take a consistent dose every day instead of 5 days of one dose and 2 days of another. Does my new prescription sound strange to any of you, or is it the case that this med stays in your system long enough that switching it on two days a week won't make me feel highs and lows? I ask because at each new dose I've tried there seems to be a somewhat tough adjustment period, and then my body becomes adjusted to the new dose and I no longer even notice I've taken anything. Concerned about switching it up every week. Thanks in advance.\n",

What do you think about the size down? End stage of hashimotos?\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "I posted yesterday about being diagnosed with Hashi's. I was told on another board (yes I posted on another forum, being a bit erratic and desperate for answers ) that because of my antibody results I need to ask for an ultrasound. This makes sense and I'm not sure why doctors wouldn't automatically schedule one to rule out cancer or tumors. Here's where I might lose some of you. I have a device called a frequency generator. It sends frequencies into your body to kill or heal certain things. I've been using it for about 3 years and yes, it works and has helped me feel better with this thyroid issue. (It has an endocrine balance frequency that I put on when I am feeling hyper and it does a good job at taking the edge off and bringing me back to a livable level.) This machine also has an option to do a \"biofeedback scan\". I haven't done a scan on myself for a couple of years, because nothing that bad was going on. What it does is to go through thousands of frequencies, applying each one to your body, while you have a pulse detector on. It measures your stress levels to each frequency and gives you a list of your top 20 hits (things that are stressing your body at this time). Low and behold, Cancer Pheochromocytoma was my #1 stressor. I looked it up, and basically it means tumor in the endocrine system. When this all first started, I had pain in my ovaries and pancreas as well as my thyroid. (Also, lyme came up in many of the other hits.) Are any of you familiar with this? Do tumors in one area of the endocrine system mean there may be more in the other areas? BTW- my frequency database was how I figured out I had thyroid issues in the first place, after the doctor put me on antibiotics.\n",
      "Hello, everyone. I have recently been diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease. It's taken me some time (especially with all of the brain fog and fatigue) to understand the little that I do about what is happening to me. Last year I had an episode- I became very very dizzy, almost fainted and thought I was having a heart attack. ER showed nothing. Doctor gave me vertigo meds and sent me home. I was fatigued, heart palps, brain fog and vertigo for over a month, but I got better. I forgot about it. About 4 months ago I started to become very ill. Basically I had every single symptom of hyperthyroid with a goiter. The doctor gave me antibiotics but I knew that wasn't it so I researched. It felt like a \"thyroid storm\". I demanded that he take tests, so he took very minimal tests and put me on synthroid .025. Results were: TSH: 5.7 (Normal Range- 0.450-4.500) T4, free: 1.01 (NR- 0.82-1.77) I needed a new doctor. I went to a doctor who specializes in thyroids. She stated that I have Hashimoto's. Results were: T3 free: 2.4 (NR 2-4.44) T4 free: 1.03 (NR .82-1.77) TSH: 2.030 (NR .450-4.5) Those were all within range, but antibodies were not: Thyroglobulin Antibody: 2.2 (NR 0-.9) TPO: 316 (NR 0-34) My problem is that I keep fluctuating between feeling extremely hyper and extremely hypo. I've had to quit my job because the symptoms are so severe. I stopped taking any of the meds because of the way they bounced me around. My doctor was upset that I stopped them and assures me that I am not going hyper (which is the worse of the two, imo) and says maybe it is STRESS! This makes me doubt her as a doctor. She suggested that my body is too sensitive to t3 and I needed to get off of naturethroid and go back to synthroid at a higher level. Well I didn't, because regardless of what she says I know when I feel hypo, moderate or hyper. They have very different symptoms! Looking over my results again today, I am confused. Why have none of the tests shown irregular t3 or t4? Why would they put me on these meds when the only irregularity I see are antibodies?\n",
      "Help. I am hypothyroid and have been doing ok on Synthroid for about 7 yrs. well starting about march things got bad. Anxiety/depression, dryness of mouth and vagina, weight gain, extreme fatigue, hoarseness, dry hair, cold feet, you name it. Well my blood results came back positive ANA and TPO 419. Waiting to get a referral to an Endo. Do you think that high number could be causing this?? My gp is test thyroid tsh and others too. Just took that blood test today. Advice please\n",
      "My TSH is 1.430 and T4 is 0.82. Stupidly I haven't taken my Synthroid in a while. Feeling really tired.\n",
      "I have been on Armour Thyroid 90mg for about 5 years and now feeling lots of brain fog, fatigue, joint pain, stiffness etc. Do I need to up my dosage? Doc thinks I am right where I should be. We tested for lyme as well but negative. Here are the labs from last week: TSH = 2.6 (.45 - 4.50) T4 Free = .84 (.82 - 1.77) T3 Free = 3.0 (2.0 - 4.4) Thanks for your time and help!\n",
      "Hi Thyroid Disorders forum, This is my first post so let me say Hello & Thank You for any help ahead of time. I have been dealing with a large number of health symptoms for the past 6 years and have had no luck getting treatment until recently I switched doctors and he's actually started to take me seriously and help and run some tests. Initially he just ran TSH and FT4 for my thyroid which came back with elevated TSH, then I paid out of pocket to run a thorough thyroid panel on the WellnessFX platform a few weeks later which seems to have come back relatively normal(though not optimal)? (However both came back with negative TPOAb and positive TGAb), I need help understanding these test results. I don't understand why my TPOAb levels are negative yet my TGAb levels point to an autoimmune diagnosis? This seems to be uncommon? is this a definitive diagnosis of hashimoto's? The most severe of my symptoms are Chronic Fatigue, Brain Fog, Difficulty reading & learning, Difficulty specifically with short term memory, incredible difficulty waking up in the morning, yet I do have rare days where I feel energized, and rare nights where I just cant sleep, they are just not as frequent as the fatigue. For the last 4 years I've had really bad stomach pains, cramps, bloating, constant gas, until 3 weeks ago the new Dr. prescribed ivermectin and nearly all of my stomach issues went away overnight. I don't know if this is related, but I still don't know what parasite was causing the issues -- I did a stool sample test for ova & parasites a week after taking the ivermectin, it might have been to late to find out? I don't have those results yet. I've done a serious amount of research into trying to understand all of this, but it's difficult with the brain fog, from what I can understand an ideal TSH is around 1.46 mIU/L and mine was 4.540 in one test, and 2.25 in the second test a few weeks later. From what I can tell an ideal Free T3 is somewhere around 3.7 and mine is 3, and ideal Free T4 is 1.515 and mine is 1.1? From what I can tell the FT3/RT3 ratio should ideally be over 20, and mine's 17? Also, from what I can tell the TT3/RT3 ratio should ideally be over 10, and mine is 4.82? If anyone more enlightened on this topic could look through my lab results below and help me to understand what this means & where I should head from here, I would be extremely appreciative. My new Dr. initially prescribed 100mcg of T4/Levothyroxine along with 5mcg of T3/Liothyronine but he said it was really up to me if I take either of them, and what amount I start at. These seem like really high doses in comparison to others for my levels?

      "I'm brand new to this forum thing, I was diagnosed with a thyroid goiter in my teens, and nodules about 6 years ago. I go in periodically for check ups. 2 years ago was the last check- the sizes of the nodules: 0.7x 0.7 x 0.6cm, 0.8, 1.1, 0.7cm, 0.4x 0.3x 0.2cm, plus 3 new small ones 3-4mm on the right. Some with \"mild internal blood flow suggested, isoechoic, hypoechoic, complex\" whatever that means. On the left 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5cm, 0.4 x 0.9x 1.0cm. TSH 3.276-normal, T3- 3.2-normal, T4- 1.5- normal. I had a nuclear study which I think said- no hot or cold nodules. I am usually hyper-feeling, sweating and hot, higher pulse and blood pressure, scatterbrained. Once in a while I feel irritated and tired. Most recently I have been feeling choked/tight pressure in my neck especially when laying down or turning my head to the left or looking down. I made an appointment to see my family doctor but I'm just wondering what the experts have to say. I'm uneducated in this whole area and want to be prepared. Thanks!\n",
      "Hi, after 2 years of awful Graves' disease and T3 thyroidtoxicosi, I ended up with a Thyroidectomy as I was so ill. I didn't expect a magic response, but I didn't expect the dreadful symptoms I endure now. I know it's early day...nearly a month, but dear god, I feel so dreadful at night. I can't sleep, when I do I have awful nightmares!!! My hands and feet tingle, elbows and knees hurt painfully. Mood swings..well , I'm crying while I write this, I'm no crybaby but I feel so alone. My endocrinologist sent me to the surgeon and signed me off , saying his part is over! My dr looked up thyroid calcium oroblems on google earlier!!! The hospital says to stop ad cal calcium if I get tingles and pins and needles, so I did, and had a blood test. It showed I'm on the higher normal range of 2.55 -- 2.6 is the max ' normal range' . So my dr says to resume calcium. I feel distrustful , and worried, I feel nauseous in the evenings, and very anxious about my health. Please tell me it gets better. The thought of the rest of my life like this fills me with despair and horror . Thanks for listening ....\n",
      "Hi I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease a year ago, and was a relief as I always knew something was wrong. I am still having problems in the fact I am always tired, have low energy and whenever I get a cold, it turns into flu and am off work for maybe 3 weeks or more at a time. I only work 28 hours a week, as this seemed manageable to me, but I still seem to get every cold going. I am being treated and am now on 100mg of Levothyroxine for 5 days and for 2 days on 150mg to keep my antibodies low. My TSH level is now 1 so the meds seems to be working but doesn't explain these issues. I also take iron, probiotics and vitamin D tablets. I saw online that it may be good to cut out gluten from the diet or also follow a special paleo diet. I wondered if anyone has tried a special diet and if it had good results? I am wondering if I one can have a normal life with Hashimoto or do you need to change your life style. At the moment it seems like a disability that no-one can see. I sometimes try to play it down and pretend I am OK, but lately my life has been restricted as I don't feel like going out anymore and get embarrassed to tell friends that I am ill again. I also can't drink anymore as it lowers my immune system. Even 2 glasses of wine can give me a headache the next morning. Can anyone give me any guidance? Many Thanks.\n",

      "I'm in a pickle. I was diagnosed with Graves' Disease last year and had RAI treatment last July (2016). I've been on levothyroxine starting Aug 2016. My TSH has continued to be very elevated (8.4 at last check) and they've continually increased my levothyroxine levels so I'm at 188mcg now. My concern is that despite the high TSH, I have had a LOT of hyperthyroid symptoms: Heat intolerance Sweats Elevated HR Elevated BP Restlessness/Insomnia Hair loss Dry skin/eyes/everything Diarrhea About the only hypothyroid symptom I have noticed is that I bruise extremely easily (anything beyond a light touch) and I heal extremely slowly (I have bruises and a couple small cuts from ~3-4 wks ago). My endocrinologist just keeps telling me \"The TSH is high, so you're hypothyroid.\" But clearly -something- is going on here. I've ruled out my other diagnosed illnesses/medications- the only one I'm on that might have any effect is Adderall and at the recommendation of my psychiatrist I stopped that for over a week but had absolutely zero change in symptoms (other than ADD-related ones popping back up...). There are no other endocrinologists within about an hour and a half drive so I'm turning to the internet. Anyone had this problem before?\n",
      "New to all this and would appreciate others’ thoughts who have experience. 50 year old male, fatigued much of my adult life, but just work through it. High stress lifestyle due to self-employment and working significant hours, often well into the night. Very erratic sleep patterns, tend to work and be most productive at night, and regardless of how little or how much sleep, I never feel rested or energetic. Constipation for years, and more recently senior moments (forgetting train of thought while speaking), and increased anxiety symptoms manifest where they use to never (such as sweating), and colder than others when it’s cold, hotter than others when it’s warm. I actually appear (outwardly) to be in very good shape…fit, very little fat…and I do some light weights a few times a week, but seldom any aerobic exercise. Do not generally go to doctors, and believe more in functional vs. conventional healthcare, but symptoms have gotten worse and appeared to be signs of hypo and hyper thyroid, so got an elective body scan and ordered some thyroid and hormone tests. Below are the results: CT Scan: Thyroid gland is heterogeneous in appearance with a questionable 4mm low attenuated nodule on the left. Thyroglobulin:__26.5______Range 3-40 ng/mL (optimal 3-10) Total T4:______3.7 (low)___Range 5-10.8 ug/dL Free T4:______1.2________Range 0.7-2.5 ng/dL Free T3:______3.2________Range 2.4-4.2 pg/mL TSH:________ 8.9 (high)___Range 0.5-3.0 uU/mL TPOab:_______267 (high)__Range 0-150 IU/mL Estradiol:_____1.2________Range 0.5-2.2 pg/mL Progesterone:__41________Range 12-100 pg/mL Testosterone:__135_______Range 44-148 pg/mL DHEAS:_______17.0______Range 2-23 ng/mL Cortisol:_______5.3_______Range 3.7-9.5 ng/mL (morning) Cortisol:_______4.1 (high)__Range 1.2-3.0 ng/mL (noon) Cortisol:_______20.2 (high)_Range 0.6-1.9 ng/mL (evening) Cortisol:_______9.6 (high)__Range 0.4-1.0 ng/mL (night) I was told the nodule may be nothing to be concerned about, or could be an issue, and to have my TSH tested, which I later did. You can see the thyroid results show a number of out of range numbers. Further, my cortisol numbers (stress hormones) are off the charts. Oddly, Testosterone is quite high, and while it doesn’t show above, the amount is significantly higher for a 50 y.o. male (even though I don’t have any high libido or interest in sex). So I booked an appointment with an Endocrinologist, yet it will take 3 months to see me (most wouldn’t see me w/o a referral (I don’t have a primary), and one was even offended that I got my own tests). So while I wait, any ideas, thoughts? There is so much contradictory information it seems out there, and so much of the body is interrelated, you don’t know if the problem is the thyroid itself, or the thyroid issue is caused by something else.\n",
      "Hello, I have had a history of medical problems. They include: nerve pain, muscle pain (perhaps not -- it might be all neurological), neuropathic itching (I think it's neurological because there isn't dryness or redness), depression, anxiety, fatigue, cold hands/feet, dry nose, burning mouth, mild gingivitis, acid reflux (surgically repaired), carpal tunnel syndrome. Probably more, but this is off the top of my head. I also tend to have body temp on the lower end of the normal spectrum (ranging 96.5F-98.5F, avg of around 97F), which I have read could be indicative of hypothyroidism. Anyway, I have been told that I have subclinical hypothyroidism, based on bloodwork over the years. I have have at times wondered if that could be the cause of some of these problems. I don't really have all the classic symptoms, and my numbers are not conclusive though. Here they are: 07/09/2012 TSH 5.22 mIU/L (0.40-4.50) Free T4 1.4 ng/dL (0.8-1.8) 02/15/2013 TSH 2.29 mIU/L (0.40-4.50) Total T3 86 ng/dL (76-181) Total T4 7.0 ug/dL (4.5-12.0) TPO Ab <10 IU/mL (<30) Tg Ab <20 IU/mL (<20) 05/30/2013 TSH 7.09 mcIU/mL (0.50-4.50) 07/03/2013 TSH 2.03 mcIU/mL (0.50-4.50) Free T4 1.4 ng/dL (0.8-1.8) Total T3 1.03 ng/mL (0.80-2.00) TPO Ab 24 WHO Units (<100) 04/07/2014 TSH 2.84 mcIU/mL (0.50-4.50) 01/21/2016 TSH 3.50 u[IU]/mL (0.50-4.50) 03/01/2017 TSH 4.69 u[IU]/mL (0.50-4.50) Free T4 1.4 ng/dL (0.8-1.8) Now that I look at it completely, my numbers are usually well within the normal range, so I am fairly doubtful that it is the cause of my problems, but I've been getting frustrated with these problems and want to try something new. Anyhow, I am considering doing a trial of T4 or T3 replacement for a little while (on my own -- starting with just T4). I just want to know if this could cause permanent problems with my thyroid and cause real hypothyroidism if I didn't have it in the first place. I know this can happen with the testes, for example, for people who regularly take exogenous testosterone or steroids. To my knowledge, this suppresses testes and can cause permanent damage to them, and I wondered if this could happen with the thyroid since the thyroid would be suppressed in the presence of exogenous thyroid hormone.\n",
      "My questions are: How long does it take to adjust to Cytomel? Do the strange dreams go away? Does sleep every normalize? Any dosing/ titration tips? Read on for the full story. I had a completion thyroidectomy due to cancer in April. My initial dose of Tirosint (Synthroid did not work for me-- tried that briefly in December after my partial thyroidectomy) after the completion surgery was 112 mcg. I went slightly hyper on that and had horrible insomnia, so my endocrinologist agreed to reduce my dose to 100 mcg. (My thyroglobulin level is undetectable, so TSH does not need to be kept very low.) I felt a bit better on 100, but still having trouble sleeping and after a while also felt oddly tired in the afternoon, so I went to my PCP for new blood tests July 31. My T3 was low and TSH was high, so she agreed to add Cytomel. (All my test results are below.) I started on 2.5 mcg (half a pill), but had bad insomnia (felt great the next two days, though-- very energetic and productive!) and so reduced to .25 of a pill (1.25 mcg). I was feeling tired after a week on 1.25, so increased to 2.5 mcg again Saturday. Saturday night I slept better than I have in months, but was sleepy during the day which disappointed me because the first time I took 2.5 I felt great the next day. I took 2.5 again yesterday and slept OK (maybe too much-- almost nine hours), but had crazy dreams and am once again sleepy today. Will the crazy dreams go away? Should I stick at this 2.5 dosage or go back to 1.25? Or maybe even increase to 3/4 of a pill (3.75)? How long does it take to get used to Cytomel? Does sleep ever normalize? I am confused as to why initially I had insomnia and great energy and now the opposite. (Sorry, I am having to do a bit of experimentation on myself because it is difficult to see my endo. and my pcp has limited knowledge of thyroid conditions. And even my endo has been mystified by some of my problems. In general, I am very sensitive to medications that affect hormones and neurotransmitters.) June 8 results (Free T3 was not tested.) TSH 2.1 (range 0.4 - 4.5) Free T4 1.94 (range 0.8 - 1.8) July 31 results TSH 6.09 (range 0.35 - 5.50) Free T4 1.58 (range 0.89 - 1.76) Free T3 1.9 (range 2.2-4.2)\n",
      "I was recently diagnosed with Hashi's and my TSH is high although my other numbers (minus a high TPO antibodoes) are still OK. My main complaint, other than heavy periods, is dizziness.

      "Hi, Has anyone had shingles with an underactive thyroid, if so, has this increased symptoms? I was diagnosed last year with an underactive thyroid, last month my levels were in 'normal range' however, I still felt fatigued, aching joints etc. After further blood tests I was diagnosed with iron deficient anaemia so started on iron tablets, two weeks ago I was diagnosed with shingles! Since then symptoms I experienced prior to diagnosis of underactive thyroid have returned. My GP is reluctant to redo bloods for thyroid function advising that it is likely symptoms of shingles, I'm not convinced! Has anyone experienced this?

      "Hello all, For a few months now, I have had a strange sensation of \"fullness\", at the base of my neck. I have no pain, just this very uncomfortable sensation of fullness (and choking, when I lay down). The choking feels as if a hand, or something were pushing against my esophagus. My previous routine labs do not show abnormal thyroid values. I have not had any detailed studies of the area or of the thyroid. This is a very strange sensation that doesn't allow me to lay on my back. The \"fullness\" becomes more pronounced when I am laying on my back, and it makes me feel like I am choking. This also happens if I am laying on my side. I find myself constantly adjusting the pillow, as well as the position of my neck and face, in the attempt to find a \"better\" position and avoid the \"choking\" sensation. I have mentioned it to my gastroenterologist about 2 months ago, during a regular follow-up for GERD and IBS. He examined my neck, but said he didn't feel any enlargement of the Thyroid and didn't know what it could be. He didn't suggest seeing my regular doctor; however, I have now made an appointment for next week, because the sensation is becoming increasingly more bothersome. Does anyone in this forum know what these \"fullness\" and \"choking\" sensations may be attributable to? Thanks,\n",

I was recently diagnosed with Eosinophillic Esophagitis (this all started with dysphagia - barium swallow indicated enlarged thyroid). I have ongoing discomfort in my neck. I've never had any surgeries, aside from two c-sections. Any insight will be greatly appreciated! <<FINDINGS: The right lobe of the thyroid measures 2.4 cm AP x 3.2 cm transverse x 7.3 cm longitudinal, with estimated volume of 20.7 mL. The right lobe of the thyroid is diffusely heterogeneous with cystic degeneration throughout. There is a dominant anechoic nodule with internal septation and peripheral vascularity that measures 1.7 x 1.9 x 2.2 cm in the inferior right lobe of the thyroid. This is suggestive of colloid cyst. The isthmus is normal in thickness measuring 0.2 cm, without focal nodule. The left lobe of the thyroid is absent. There is a hypodense focus in the left thyroid bed that most likely represents a lymph node with normal fatty hilum that measures 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.8 cm. No vascularity noted. Visualized portions of the carotid and jugular vessels are patent bilaterally. No abnormal lymph nodes are seen in the neck. IMPRESSION: 1. Diffusely heterogeneous right lobe of the thyroid with complex colloid cyst located inferiorly. 2. Absent left lobe of the thyroid. Unsure of etiology. Patient denies previous hemithyroidectomy. Small hypoechoic focus in the left thyroid gland may represent lymph node versus residual thyroid. 3. No abnormal neck lymphadenopathy. >>\n",

After 3 months, my medications were down to 6 PTU a day and 2 Inderal 40mg as prescribed of endoc.

      "Hello, I am awaiting lab test results that should be up today, but thought I would go ahead an get a jump on some questions I have. In 2013 I was sent to an endocrinologist regarding a nodule on my thyroid, biopsy was done. I was told to go back every year for a check up. Either I don't remember, or I didn't think it was significant, but I never thought the biopsy results were of any concern. Kept putting off my follow up appointments. This year I decided to go back. Had my appointment yesterday. The doctor told me my biopsy 13 years ago showed Thyroiditis. Yesterday he did another ultrasound and said my thyroid is still enlarged. I'm not sure if he said he didn't notice any significant nodules, or that the nodule didn't change, or if there were no nodules. He talked so quiet! Anyway, on my chart online it says, Thyroiditis, autoimmune. He again told me to come back in a year for a follow up. He did blood work which I will get the results of later today. The tests he ran are TSH, Free T4, and TPO (as far as I can make sense of them). My regular doctor has periodically done thyroid levels and they have always come back good, but I do not know the specific tests. I believe my father has hypothyroid (ism??) I have emailed him to find out more. My question is: what is Thyroiditis, autoimmune? Can it really be diagnosed without abnormal blood work and with a biopsy? What do I need to watch out for? Do I need meds if my labs come back normal? Why do I have to go back for yearly ultrasounds? I could have asked my doctor yesterday, but my brain apparently wasn't working during the appointment.\n",

I have a question about the thyroid scan I had yesterday. When they brought me into the room I was told that they were going to do a two minute scan and then a series of ten minute scans. They did the two minute scan, reviewed it, and then told me they got the shots they needed and didn't need to do the ten minute scans. I didn't press them for more since I know the techs aren't supposed to share details. Everything I see only says that the scan usually takes around a half hour.

Leading up to now my TSH has been very low (0.01), T3 has been high (4.3), TSI is high (644), Free T4 was high normal (1.7). A CBC done a few months ago revealed a first time issue of a low white cell count (3.7). The endocrinologist sent me for a recheck bloodwork last week (about two months after my last test), prior to getting a RAI test done. My TSH is still low (0.02), my Free T3 has normalized (3.4); my Free T4 has dropped but stayed within normal range (1.1), my white cell count is even lower (3.3), and I now have a low absolute monocytes count as well (198); which dropped some 94 points from a couple of months ago. The endocrinologist called afterward, asking me to follow through with the RAI next week and to come in for my follow up so my doctor and I can discuss the \"potential causes\" of what is going on. It sounded quite ominous and reading that low monocytes is usually associated with cancer, not Graves Disease has me a little concerned.

      "I had a TT in June 2016. I started levothyroxine 75mcg afterwards. I found out during my follow up visit that my thyroid nodules were papillary carcinoma and would have to take a radioactive iodine pill to destroy any remaining thyroid tissue. After meeting with my first endo she took me off my thyroid meds in preparation for rai After a while, (not sure how long, as my memory is not what it used to be and I don't have the energy to go look up my history of the many MANY emails I wrote her that she ignored), I started to feel that something wasn't right. I was exhausted, my body hurt to try to walk, I couldn't focus on anything, I couldn't take care of my kids, much less myself, my speech was very slow and slurred, I was stuttering when I would talk, and I was freeeeeezing all the time...Yet still, she ignored me. After I finally got my blood tests back my TSH was 206. I left her an email letting her know, so we could start rai. I didn't hear back for a few days when a colleague of hers called, heard the way I spoke andinformed me I couldn't take rai and I needed to get back on my meds immediately or I could die. Of course I broke down, couldn't believe after all the things I was going through I was going to have to start over. My husband did as he was told and gave me 2 doses of my meds and we went to bed. The next day I was not any better so we went to the e.r. I was put in the icu with myedema coma. My body was failing, my liver blood tests(alt and ast) were through the roof (they were fine before hand). It took a long time to feel even slightly \"normal\" after all that, my body needed time to heal. By January 2017 I was finally able to complete RAI, I'm still in the process of determining the dosage of meds I need (one is not enough, another is too much). My stutter has gone away but I can no longer handle anything stressful. I am still fighting exhaustion but some days are better than others. I no longer have patience, I have high anxiety, I forget words or use other(incorrect) words. I still have an intolerance to cold, and suffers from bouts of depression. I also lose my voice if I talk too long, as if my voicebox just gets tired. I've also gone from 106lbs to 97lbs. For some reason, and this just started about a month ago, Im lactose intolerant. I have had my liver checked a few times since the hospital but not since the end of 2016, the last word was I now have an incurable liver disease.

      "Hi everyone, I have been suffering with symptoms that I believe to be Hyperthyroidism for almost one full year now. Last September I had severe hyperthyroidism (TSH was 0.001). I tested positive for Graves Antibodies (Antibody number was so high that it could not be read, a later test scored a 550 -- very high indeed since it should be less than 1). When I got in to see an endocrine (it was an emergent appointment, obviously), he sent me for an Iodine Uptake Test. All of this is/was really new to me. I had no idea about the Uptake Test, and the doctor didn't say much, so I assumed it was like an x-ray with contrast. The first available uptake appointment I could get was 3 weeks from my appointment. I ended up at the appointment and the tech asks me to sign all of this paperwork basically saying I will not sue the hospital if the radioactive iodine treatment renders me infertile... I asked her what she meant by treatment, and she told me I was there for the test and that the doctor had stipulated on my paperwork that I was to be treated with radioactive iodine to ablate my thyroid. She goes into this long monologue about how I can't sleep in the same bed as my husband, have to flush 3-5 times, and can't throw away my trash for x-amount of months. I probably looked scared, as I was, because she asked if any of this was reviewed by my doctor. I told her no, and she told me, \"Well, he wants you treated with radioactive iodine to ablate your thyroid... are you ready to get started?\" I left the appointment. None of this had been reviewed with me, and I was only 26, I wanted children. If this had to happen, then I wanted options for how to preserve my eggs, etc. By the time I was able to see another endocrine, my blood tests had leveled out. EXCEPT, I still had high traces of antibodies, had a nodule on my right side of my thyroid and my right side of my thyroid was measuring larger than the left. Further, I still had the bumps and raised red skin on my shins, and I still had all the typical symptoms still ripping and roaring (increased rate rate -- typically resided at about 120bpm resting; inability to concentrate/foggy; increased bowel movements; irritability; history of 4 miscarriages; a blood test showed slightly increased sugar levels; hand tremors; shortness of breath; dizziness; thinning hair; lightened periods; itchiness/hives; extreme fatigue, despite having crazy insomnia; increased perspiration; increased appetitie, despite weight loss (of 10lbs); muscle weakness -- could not work out like I used to; eye trouble, etc. A year later, my PCP has tested me for everything and everything has come back normal. Except very mild Vitamin D deficiency/Anemia that is right below the \"normal\" threshold, and not enough to make me feel this way. I am incredibly miserable. I am at my wits end. I do not feel like myself in the least. I am so exhausted that I literally cannot do anything. Part of me feels crazy because I'm being told I'm fine. A cardiologist who ran my stress test told me I am \"anxious\" and to \"get a therapist\" as he walked out. Funnily enough, I am a therapist AND I have been seeing one steady for 4 years -- and my therapist tells me I'm fine. (Which I know I am considering I'm a mental health professional, I would never downplay or completely dismiss MH.) I am going into a doctoral program in the Fall and I am so worried because I am constantly fatigued and I have intense difficulty focusing, on top of all of the above. Does anybody have any experiences like this? Can you be positive for Graves Antibodies but not have the TSH/T3/T4 levels to substantiate it? I really don't know where to go from here.\n",
      "I was just recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism/likely graves. However my symptoms have gone on for YEARS and during that time my thyroid tested normal. About 4 years ago, I started having symptoms on my right side of my body. Not pain, but like a weird altered sensation, almost like my right side of my body was stressed at all times. Felt it from the top of my head to my toes. My dr suspected MS initially and did an MRI. Normal. He referred me to a neurologist whom I suspected thought I was just crazy so I never went back. Symptoms slowly faded over the years, but I had occasional relapses that were short lived. I know I had two TSH, T3 and T4 tests that were trending towards hyper, but still with in normal ranges. I've started having more symptoms starting this past January. They have built up since then until it seemed to peak with more symptoms in May. I was extremely dizzy, racing uncomfortable heart beat, short of breath sweating like CRAZY and my right sided symptoms were awful. It's like I have restless right side of my body syndrome. I was scared I was having a heart attack, so went to the dr. He did an EKG, said it was a virus and a panic attack. It got a little better but persisted for the past two months. My mom and grandmother had graves disease, so I thought I would check that myself with one of those online labs since my doctor didnt' order one. Here are my recent results: TSH - 0.011 (0.45 - 4.5) T4,Free - 5.79 (0.82-1.77) T3, Free - 18.9 (2-4.4) TPOAb - 10 (0-34) TgAB - 1.9 (0-0.9) Vitamin D - 33.3 (30-100) Ferritin - 25 (15-150) So, I went back to my dr who seemed irritated I did bloodwork on my own, he prescribed beta blockers and referred me to an endo. Had a ultrasound done, showed enlarged thyroid and one large (3cm) solid nodule and a tiny cyst. Saw endo, she prescribed 10mg methimazole 3X a day, and told me to up the beta blockers since my pulse was 160 there. She ordered more bloodwork, said to take vitamin D and iron because they both were lower than she likes. That was a week ago. Since then my resting pulse has gone from 95ish to 85ish, but my heart rate walking around is still in the 130s. It's uncomfortable and sometimes I honestly feel like I'm dying. Just taking a shower and walking around the house will send my heart rate from the 80s to 120 in minutes. Does this sound like all hyperthyroid? I feel like my symptoms seem dramatic for my levels. I'm having a hard time thinking it could all be simply hyperthyroid. Thanks so much!\n",

      "Hi, I'm new here and looking for some insight. I'm 27 and have had some symptoms of hypothyroid for years. 3/4 years ago I had bloods that the doctor just said were normal and never thought about it again, although I know I have those results around here somewhere. Then recently had my thyroid checked as part of recurrent miscarriage testing but my consultant only checked my TSH which I was told was normal and nothing else. At this point I decided to dig a little deeper on my own and went private for a more detailed check including antibodies. These were positive although not far out of range, however all the function tests are normal, FT4 is borderline low but not sure what anything means so hoping someone with more experience can give me an opinion. Here are my results: TSH - 2.09 mIU/L [0.27 - 4.20] FT4 - 12.46 pmol/L [12.00 - 22.00] T4 - 92.0 nmol/L [59.00 - 154.00] FT3 - 4.85 pmol/L [3.10 - 6.80] Thyroglobulin antibody - 127.300 IU/mL [0.00 - 115.00] Thyroid peroxidase antibodies - 35.32 IU/mL [0.00 - 34.00] The thyroid check included a few other bits too: Vitamin B12 - 257 pmol/L [140.00 - 724.00] Folate - >19.98 ug/L [2.91 - 50.00] Ferritin - 45.09 ug/L [13.00 - 150.00] The B12 seems a bit on the low side so I'll be getting some supplements, but not sure if anything else could do with a boost. Any thoughts about the whole thing? Should I just accept that nothing is out of range enough to be treated? Thank you in advance\n",
      "So, ive been having swallowing issues for about a month now. Went to an ENT specialist and put a tube down my throat as well as felt my neck. They saw and felt absolutely nothing and said it was in my head. Could thyroid cancer behave like this? It's what im currently worried about. I saw the ENT yesterday. My lymph nodes also swelled but they were accompanied green/yellow mucus with a cough. They're still swollen but havent gotten any bigger, nor are they hard, theyre squishy and movable. My mucus is clear now and I believe that the nodes are meshing with my skin once again. I also get anxiety (could this be hypothyroidism?) but not really unless I read a story about people who went to an ENT who didn't find anything but ended up having cancer. A month ago when I first started experiencing swallowing issues, It happened suddenly one night hours after eating dinner, i was laying down and felt an (almost sudden) lump in my throat and I instantly had swallowing issues, I rushed to an ER. They did an X-ray and found nothing, that day. Should I be worried? I dont know if its globus hystericus because ive felt that before and when I get (even more) stressed I can feel that same feeling I used to feel. The swallowing issue has been going on for a month and a few weeks. The nodes appeared on both sides of my neck last week. The ones on my left side appeared last week, and they ones on my right side appeared ealrlier this week seemingly throughout the day. There's also an inconsistent clicking in my adams apple when I swallow. Any ideas? Help!!?\n",

      "I've been having several blood tests come back with really low numbers for my thyroid (like 0.03 and things like that). My primary referred me to an endocrinologist who sent me for more bloodwork and an ultrasound prior to seeing him. Apparently I have a nodule which has grown from several years ago (though is still very small - so small the doctor can't feel it), have a low white cell count, and other things that indicate that I probably have Graves Disease. However, on examination, I really have no symptoms of Graves Disease other than that my bloodwork and ultrasound indicate, that I have heightened reflexes (which I guess is common?) and heart palpitations (which I've had for years due to mitral valve prolapse). Anyway, he wants to send me for a radioactive iodine uptake and scan. His statement on my order form for the test was \"asap, this week\". I've gone to Hell trying to schedule this test.... lab not receiving my referral, doctor not calling me back, lab not taking my insurance, new lab not receiving my referral, doctor not calling me back again. Its now been two weeks since he wanted the test done. I finally got it scheduled today, under the pretense that I needed to check my multivitamin to make sure it doesn't contain iodine. If it does, they said they would need to push it back three weeks because I can't have any iodine three weeks prior to my test. I looked, and of course it has iodine. Do I really have to call and cancel this test? Its not until Monday, and I forgot to take my vitamin today, which would give me six days without it prior to the test. No iodine for three weeks seems overkill, most places I'm looking at online only say one week. I asked he about iodine in natural foods, and she said to have none at all for the three weeks!!! What am I supposed to eat.... everything out there has iodine in it (eggs, bread, cheese, milk, seafood, meat). Is it really that important to avoid all those foods? I just really want to get this test over and done with so they can find out what's wrong and I can be treated before I go into thyroid storm or something, and my doctor wanted this test done weeks ago. If I have to wait three weeks, I'm going to have to reschedule my next appointment with him to review my results because I won't have had the test yet. Should I keep the Monday test despite my usage of multivitamins, or do I have to cancel? Secondly, I have a history of hepactic adenoma caused by long term use of birth control pills due to my endometriosis. I was taken off the pill in an effort to get rid of the adenoma (which seems to have worked, as of my last scan it was gone), but was told by two different doctors (my ob/gyn and my GI overseeing my liver) to make sure I never took hormones, otherwise the adenoma could come back and could either turn into cancer or hemmorage. If I do have a thyroid problem, am I even going to be able to take treatment for it? Or are thyroid hormones different than \"female-hormones\"?\n",
      "Hi There, Background: This is my first post. I have known for some time, something hasn't been right with my health. I suspected thyroid issues, but, saw a number of doctors who ultimately told me nothing was wrong. I was also diagnosed with major depression and an anxiety disorder that I always felt were the symptoms from some other undiagnosed problem(s). Consequently, I have been searching for my root causes and I just received my lab results back. Nobody likes abnormal lab results, but, I may have uncovered my first puzzle pieces to recovery and I couldn't be happier. If I wasn't on my depression medication I'm sure I would have tears in my eyes. After telling family and friends that something isn't right and it's not all in my head, I finally feel somewhat vindicated! Question: I would appreciate your thoughts and expertise on my lab results. I have additional lab results I can share, but, I wanted to start off with what I believe are my primary Thyroid related results. My Free T3 is in the high range at 4.9, while the normal range is 2.2 to 4.0. The other item I noticed was my TBG was in the normal range, but barely: my result was 14.6 and the normal range was 14-31. I am happy to post symptoms or anything else you may find helpful. Thank you in advance and for your time. Kind Regards, Jack\n",

      "I have no clue what's going on with me. I thought it was just a change in my thyroid med manufacturers that didn't agree with me but now I'm beginning to wonder if there isn't something else going on. I feel horrendous. Horrible fatigue, can't seem to regulate my temp so I swing from too cold to so overheated I'm in a full body sweat and feel like I'm gonna pass out. I'm dizzy most of the time, have suddenly started having to get up in the middle of the night to pee, can't lose weight even if I starve myself, often feel nauseated after eating, struggle not to fall asleep at my computer at work starting around 1pm but then I'm so wide awake around bedtime that I don't feel like going to bed and my back hurts nearly constantly near my right kidney. Stranger yet, it seems like taking my throid meds actually makes this symptoms WORSE. When I was diagnosed Hypothyroid in late 2014 a Cortisol test was done as well that showed it being rather high in the morning (9.2 (3.7-9.5)), extremely low at noon (0.8 (1.2-3.0)), normal in the evening (1.4 (0.6-1.9))and high at night (1.4 (0.4-1.0)). I'm considering doing the testing again and see what my results look like now but does anyone else out there have hypothyroidism AND adrenal issues? Do these symptoms sound adrenal or am I simply a nutcase?\n",
      "Hello, I'm wondering if anybody else has ever had this problem. A few months ago I was complaining to the doctor that I've gained too much weight this past year and it's making me insecure. He suggested I get my thyroid checked, and my THS level came back abnormal (5.22) he didn't do any further testing. He just said we would wait 6 months and retest. I decided to do some research on the thyroid and why my levels were abnormal, and hypothyroidism came up. I've had some of the symptoms since I was in my teens .. I was always cold and needed to take a jacket everywhere, it's pointless to grow my nails cause they break, my hair falls out left & right, I can't keep a consistent weight .. it just kind of seemed like this might be what is wrong. So as soon as I moved back to Texas last week I decided to make an appointment and have my thyroid retested, and I was shocked to see that my levels were actually normal .. the THS was 1.99, the doctor didn't do any further testing this time either (idk why, I told her of the abnormal THS on my last test) .. has anybody else had this issue? and if so, did you end up having hypothyroidism? I've seen that your THS levels can vary during the day and that fasting can have some affect on your levels .. I didn't fast on the first test but on the second one I did.\n",

      "I am getting lab work done next week and I have a doctor appointment on July 25th, but I was hoping to get some insight before then. I have always been a small person fluctuating between 115-120 lbs. Since April I have gained 10 lbs. I haven't changed anything as far as diet and exercise go. I am also tired all the time which really isnt anything unusual but still annoying just the same. I have also noticed that when I brush my hair a lot more is ending up on the brush than it used to. I read online that this can be related to my thyroid. I do have a lot of thyroid conditions that run in my family so its a possibility, but I just had my TSH levels checked in October 2016 and it was 1.390 which is normal, but this is the only thyroid level that was checked. Back in 2015, my TSH was 0.92 normal, T3 0.87 normal and T4 10.9 which is high but nothing was ever said to me about it. I just noticed this today when I went on the labcorp website and saw it. I guess my question is, do you think this is likely from my thyroid since it was just normal in October? I have every symptom so to me it seems like that has to be it. Also, if my TSH comes back normal does that mean everything is definitely fine or should I push for more testing? Anything that you could tell me to help would be great! Thank you\n",
      "I'm a 39 year old single female mother of a nine-year-old. After I had my daughter 9 years ago, I started having issues with swallowing, hoarse voice. I had gastric bypass 17 years ago and I currently weigh 125 lb, have pretty much been that weight for the last 15 years. I started at 300 lb and I initially had a thyroid uptake / ultrasound whatever you called it and they found nodules. Three nodules were found and told me to watch them, how you watch a nodule is beyond me, but I followed up in a year. I had 14 nodules, mind you during this time, I've never been hypo or hyper as far as thyroid is concerned. I then had a fine needle aspiration, as well as, more ultrasounds and I had 23 of them, nodules that is. Just recently, 2 days ago I had blood work done and my liver is enlarged, I'm not a drinker and I was told to have another thyroid scan as I'm completely horse and there's more nodules.

      "I'm on 125mcg Levothyroxine and 25 mcg Liothyronine. Couple months back I noticed my pharmacy changed suppliers of the Liothyronine from Sigma to Paddock. Didn't think much about it...Until symptoms returned. I'm gaining weight at an alarming rate.. like several pounds PER WEEK. I'm also very fatigued, my days and nights are all mixed up, I go from being so cold I need a sweater to so hot & sweaty I feel like I'm gonna pass out, my periods are non-existent (again), I need stool softeners in order to \"go\", my skin & nails are visibly dry and I can't stop crying even though I have NO idea what I'm crying about. These are all symptoms that I had before I was diagnosed hypothyroid. I'm miserable and desperate to feel better. When I was on the Sigma brand Liothyronine, I could feel the effects of a dose increase as small as 5 mcg. That is not the case with the Paddock Liothyronine...In fact, it takes a dose increase to 75 mcg (!!) for me to feel even the most minor improvement. Has anyone else found that certain brands don't work? My doc thinks I'm crazy. Says T3 is T3 no matter who makes it & it all works the same.\n",
      "Good afternoon! I had a TT in July of 2012. It was a major disaster with huge multinodular goiter, masses on the left lob as big a 6.5 cm, enlarged isthmus 1.4 cm in thicknessand elarged gland or paraythyroid. Had the entire thing removed, lost one parathyroid, had another reimplanted, don't know if it took and guess the other two remained but stayed in the hospital 9 days receiving IV calcium because they weren't working. Came home on bookoodles of calcium. Fast forward to now...June 29, 2017. Am on levo 225 once daily and STILL take cacitriol 025mcg THREE times daily, two pills each time. Am told that is still a lot but calcium runs on the low side of normal still. Went to an ENDO for the first time in my life (there wasn't one near where I had the TT) to get diabetes numbers straightened. She seemed really concerned about the entire Thyroid thing. Felt of my neck for 5 minutes and asked many questions. Now, I thought I had one growing back because I could feel stuff in my neck that had not been there before and so did the ER doc. I didn't tell the endo this! She just felt and felt and looked puzzled and continued to question. I had not had an U/S since 6 months post surgery so guess who got one ASAP? ME! Anyway, the results are as follows: STUDY: US SOFT TISSUE HEAD NECK DATE: 06/20/2017. TIME: 1142 hours. HISTORY: History of thyroid cancer. Prior thyroidectomy per history. Follow-up. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: The history is that of prior thyroidectomy. The isthmus is not identified however there is tissue in the thyroid beds on both sides that have the appearance of residual thyroid glandular tissue. Right thyroid lobe: 2.4 x 0.9 x 1.4 cm Left thyroid lobe: 2.4 x 0.9 x 1.9 cm Projecting just inferior and slightly medial to the right thyroid lobe there is a hypoechoic lesion that appears to be separate from the tissue within the right thyroid bed. This measures 16 x 9 x 10 mm. Color Doppler demonstrates no increased vascularity. Parathyroid adenoma versus abnormal lymph node. Within the tissue in both the right and left thyroid beds no additional lesions are identified. There is normal color Doppler flow to these areas. On the right side of the neck there is no evidence of any adenopathy. On the left side in the mid left neck there is a lymph node that measures approximately 18 x 9 x 10 mm notched appearance, there is no abnormal increased vascularity to this. This lymph node is nonspecific with no frank adenopathy. No additional lymph nodes in the left side of the neck identified. IMPRESSION: The history is that of a prior thyroidectomy. There is however tissue in both the right and left thyroid beds that have the appearance of glandular tissue with no nodules within it. They are small thyroid lobes if these are residual thyroid tissue. Correlate with previous extent of surgery. Alternatively thyroid malignancy is difficult to exclude though these areas appear very smooth and otherwise unremarkable. Projecting just inferior to the right thyroid lobe slightly medially there is a hypoechoic solid-appearing lesion having a maximal diameter of 16 mm. There is no abnormal color Doppler flow. This could represent parathyroid adenoma or abnormal lymph node. No adenopathy in the right side of the neck. Normal appearing left mid neck lymph node with no frank adenopathy in the left side of the neck. Anyone have tissue regrowth after TT and have a return of papillary cancer 5 years later? Really concerned here because I didn't have RAI nor chemo after the TT. Was told all tissue was removed and not needed. Really, really concerned it is back and now in thyroid bed and lymph nodes or something.\n",
      "Good morning! I am having some health issues that have me so worried and on the verge of a panic attack. I noticed several weeks ago that my left jaw looked out of whack when I was washing my face. Made a trip to the dentist right away and he is very certain it's from excessive clinching/grinding (really don't think I do, but clinching yes) and gum chewing (up to a pack a day sometimes). I got fitted for a night guard that day, I will receive it next week. Fast forward a week and my neck starts to hurt. I'm told it's the muscles that are so overworked from said jaw issue. I finally get frustrated with the pain, a dull achy pain, and request an ultrasound. I opened a can of worms and I'm wishing I wouldn't have done it. Ignorance is bliss!! I am now a basket case. Here is what the radiology report says: US THYROID IMPRESSION: 1. Enlarged thyroid gland with numerous small cystic nodules involving both lobes 2. Slightly prominent lymph nodes in the left neck noted. If further investigation needed, please consider CT soft tissue neck with IV contrast. 3. Please see the details in the body of the report. HISTORY: neck pain . TECHNIQUE: Gray-scale ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland was performed, followed by limited color Doppler and Duplex Doppler assessment of the gland. FINDINGS: - The right lobe of the thyroid gland measured 6.0 x 2.1 x 1.6 cm. The left lobe measured 6.1 x 1.6 x 2.1 cm. There are numerous predominantly cystic, complex nodular lesions in both lobes of the thyroid gland. There are at least 3 such nodules in the right lobe measuring 8 mm, 7 mm and 1.1 cm. Similar predominantly cystic nodules also seen in the left lobe, measured 1.9 cm, 1.1 cm and 1.0 cm. The thyroid isthmus measured 2 mm in thickness. The right-sided submandibular gland measured 3.6 x 3.2 x 1.4 cm. The left sided submandibular gland measured 3.1 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm. There may be upper normal size lymph nodes in the left neck. I never dreamed my thyroid would be enlarged! Now I'm worried that I have a rare jaw cancer or something and it has spread to my thyroid. Please help! Have any of you had similar issues? I have never felt quite so scared.\n",

      "Hi, I'm new to this board and would like to request help in reading my lab results, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 3 years ago. I am on 50mg of Levothyroxine. Up until a few months ago, it was working great, In Dec, 2017 I was prescribed Lyrica for back and leg pain. Started out at 150mg per day and was gradually increased to 450mg per day by Feb. 2017. Around Jan. I started noticing all my hypo symptoms returning (hair loss, brittle nails, fatigue and weight gain (20 lbs), dry skin, muscle cramps etc.). Now I know some of these are also side effects of the Lyrica. When I told the Dr. of my concern, she had me complete some blood work. These are the numbers, which I'm told by my Dr. are normal. I'm just trying to figure out what the problem is ...I see where there isn't supposed to be any negative interaction between the Lyrica and Levo.

      "Hi! I'm new the this board, but have been scanning a lot of the posts, and it seems like there is a lot of helpful info. I'm a very active, otherwise healthy, 30 year old woman who has recently gained 9 lbs in 3 months without any change in diet or exercise (I have run 2 marathons since April). I am experiencing some hair loss and breakage, dry skin, fatigue, mild depressive symptoms, irritability, loss of libido, irregular periods and spotting (I do have an IUD, but these are new symptoms, beginning in Jan 17), lack of energy (especially evident when I'm running), very minor swelling around my ankles, forgetfulness/ feeling very spacey, and constipation. I went to my PCP, who did a physical exam (normal) and blood work. Here are my results: WNL: Tsh: 1.81 (lab range .55-4.78) Free T3: 2.5 (std 2.3-4.2) free T4: 1.1 (std .9-1.8) Ferritin: 29 (std 10-291) TPO antibodies: 15.8 (std 0-34) Notable: Thyroglobulin AB: 162.5 (std 0-115) I had a full CBC and metabolic panel done (all WNL). So, the only thing out of the norm is my tgab. My question is, in light of my symptoms, what seems most likely? What steps should I be taking? How do I get back to \"normal\"? I have done so much googling, I feel like I should have a google phd, but I wanted to post here, to see if I could get my personalized feedback/ suggestions and bc my PCP is out til Monday (it's Thursday today). Thanks in advance!\n",

I was on iodine along with my desiccated thyroid a few years ago but I still had somewhat of a functioning globe.

      "Hello, I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism almost a 1.5 year ago. I started with levothyroxine (euthyrox) and at the moment i take the dosage of 88mcg. Thankfully i dont feel anymore the awful symptoms that i had in the beginning (paraesthesia, muscle spasms, cold feeling in legs) BUT i think i can be better. My exams are the following : TSH = 2.04 (O.3 - 4.5) FT3 = 2.39 (2.0 - 4.0) FT4 = 1.18 (0.7 - 0.17) I think i am low in FT3 but my doctor classicaly judging only by TSH says that i am fine. I still feel fatigue sometimes and have cold feeling in legs. Should i move my dosage to 100mcg ? Thanks a lot,\n",

      "Hey ive been a hypo for almost 6 years now and ive been on medication since then and obviously i will be for the rest of my life(no problem with that). But after a while, nodules started growing on my thyroid gland. I have nodules on the left side only and since theyve been growing each year my endo decided that the time to remove the thyroid has come. Tbh before my endo even said that, i had thoughts of having my thyroid removed and i told that to her but since it wasnt the time she said it wasnt needed. Now youre gonna ask why did i have these thoughts?Well i have no knowledge( i mean real knowledge of the endocrine system and thyroid like an endo does) but everyone of us has doubts and we obviously can read certain things our body shows. My voice is normal 99% of the time. But for a while now(for some years now) my voice will go high pitch at random moments(i noticed it happens after i havent talked for some time..lets say 20 minutes etc). Then it can go ultra high for a moment before i do that thing a person does when his voice goes hoarse to make it clear. I do the same and it goes back to normal. As i said it happens at random times and not often but it sounds funny and humiliating when it does. I had the suspicions that nodules cause that. Ive noticed this problem increased a little lately and since the nodules have been growing i think maybe there is a correlation? Thats my main question..and that being said im having my total thyroidectomy in a few weeks and if that a side effect of the nodules growing then having the thyroid and the nodules removed, maybe makes it go away completely?its not sth very important but i would like it to go tbh. Sorry for the long message.\n",
      ":jester: :( I was sick for 6 years. I know it was my thyroid but every doctor blamed it on my age. I got to the point of sleeping for most of the day after a full 9-10 hours of sleep at night. One doctor found that I had did have nodes on my thyroid but didn't feel like writing a prescription! I finally found a Naturopath and Psychiatrist who confirmed my suspicions. I have Hashimoto and chronic Epstien Barr (that one was a surprise). I'm now on Nature-Throid, 2 gr. Recently a new doctor wanted to lower my meds to 1.75 gr but the Naturopath said not to. I'm finally getting my energy back but have developed burning neuropathy in both feet. Could that be related to the Hashi's? Any ideas are welcome. Thanks for allowing me into the group.\n",
      "Ok so I was diagnosed with Graves Disease 23 years ago. I have been on Synthroid at varying different dosages. Several years ago Cytomel was added. I was finally getting somewhere with all of them symptoms and then my doc started lowering my dosage of Synthroid about every 9 to 12 months. Now I am at 175 mfg and 25 mg of Cytomel. My doc says she is going to have to lower me again because my TSH levels are so low but my T3 and T4 levels are elevated. I am ready to scream. Can any tell me what is going on. I have gained weight over the last year's since they lowered my meds and all the normal side effects are back and severe. Help please.\n",

In January of this year my TSH was 6.17 and my T3 was 11.

      "I have a normal functioning thyroid but have been diagnosed with multinodular goitre. About a year or so my endo spotted a dominant solid nodule on the lower left lobe. Biopsied a year ago and thankfully it's benign (classified as an adenomatous goitre) but the thing keeps growing (it's now 3 x 2.9 x 2.4 cm). The endo suggests surgery but I am aware that there are non invasive or minimally invasive methods such as high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and radio frequency ablation (RFA). Just wondering if anyone has been faced with such a situation and have opted with RFA or HIFU over surgery and what the experience was like. Regards, Ady\n",
      "Did you find that you became so accustomed to it that it did not work anymore? For the past year, I was on gradually increasing dosages. I ended up by March on 50 mcg. of levothyroxine and .32 Naturethroid per day. I opted to take both but at different times, and felt terrific for awhile. Until all of a sudden I didn't. I'm exhausted all the time again. I wonder if the highs and lows caused by the T3 in the Naturethroid might not be good. I can't take more than the above dose, or my T3 drops to about .3 I used to feel good on .112 mcg. of levothyroxine, so switched back to that five days ago, but still feel like a zombie. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I have thyroid antibodies of 55 if that means anything. I've been told that is \"not bad\" by doctors.\n",
      "Hello everyone, have a question for anyone willing to help. I went to the hospital on July 27th for high blood pressure and heart palpitations. My resting heart rate was between 115-125 while there. They said my thyroid was enlarged but my blood work was normal. TSH- 2.03 range is 0.36-3.74, free T4 0.9 range 0.8-1.5, free T3 3.3 range 2.2-4.0. My doctor ordered an ultrasound of my thyroid but they haven't called to schedule it yet. I've had about 4 more episodes of fast heart rate since then. I have symptoms of hypo and hyper. Can anyone give me any insight? My doctor ordered more blood work which I did on Friday, but I haven't gotten the results back yet. I am a 28 year old female.\n",

The nodule measures 2cm x 2.2cm x 1.5cm Small subcentimetre nodules noted in the left lobe and isthmus Impression : Dominant nonspecific right lobe thyroid nodule. Correlation with fine needle biopsy. Does any of this sound concerning? I should mention all bloodwork came back normal.\n",
      "I had a total thyroidectomy, non-cancerous, 4 weeks ago. I didn't have major discomfort, just sore throat, sore at incision, typical stuff. Not much hoarseness or trouble speaking except just the first 48 hours after surgery. No trouble with voice/speaking until just two days ago I went to say something to my husband and it felt like what I would imagine having a fish bone stuck in your throat would feel like. I couldn't talk very loud at all or I would have that feeling. For the most part I can talk fairly normal, then every so often my voice cuts out and I have the uncomfortable feeling of something slightly sharp in my throat. Just wondering if that's normal, to have it start doing that a month later. We were at a lake and I was yelling/talking loud more than normal to be heard over the wind/waves, so I'm hoping I just aggravated a vocal chord or something temporarily. Also, my ankles have been swollen the last two nights, and still a little this morning. I am taking levothyroxine, and wondering if it's taking effect now and causing some of the swelling?...

      "I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and have been taking levothyroxine for 8 years. About a year ago I got a new doctor, he has been trying to get my tsh levels around normal (I'm pretty sure I have never been near the normal range since being diagnosed). So ever since I have this new doctor he has been upping my levo after a blood test every 3 months (he has only been testing tsh levels. I've read that they need to test free t3 and t4, but he said that once you hypo you don't need to test those. Thinking about switching doctors). Ever since he has been upping my levo I have been feeling weird and having anxiety, mostly because I feel \"not normal\". Can this been from upping my levo??? Also the last 3 times he has upped my levo my tsh levels have gone up? I was originally on 88 mcg before he start upping and now I am at 137mcg. I was on 112mcg with tsh 7.2, then 125mcg with tsh 8.7, and now 137mcg with tsh 17.2. I felt fine when I was on 88 but my tsh levels would be anywhere from 8-16. I have not idea what is going on. I never had any noticeable symptoms when I was on 88 and now that I am higher it makes me feel weird. Can anyone help me with what to do. I want to try 88mcg again but don't know if that's a smart thing to do. Also why would my tsh levels go higher when he upped my levo? Sooo sorry for the long post. I have been investigating and trying to find answers for awhile now. I have so many questions and need some advice.\n",
      "Hello I am a 61 year old female and feeling cold alot so my doctor ordered alot of blood work.

All other labs fine. My only symptom is being cold. It's June now and I have a sweater on. I recently lost 125 pounds, yes, on purpose. My doctor thinks it's just my body and metabolism adjusting but I am not so sure I agree. I've been at my goal for 4 months now. The most concerning is the T3 My question is of course there has to be a reference range and people are going to fall on the border, is that necesarily concerning? I cannot force my doctor to put me on meds when overall these results don't look too horrible. Thoughts and opinions appreciated. Thank you kindly :-) ~Suzie\n",

      "Hello everyone I am new to this site and figured I would make this post in hopes that maybe someone out there with a similar experience could help me out. So I went to my doctor recently and got a blood test done because I was worried about my thyroid. My results came back that : -My T3 is high (4.6) -Low T4 (.8) -I have high cholesterol, which I find odd because I have really cleaned up my eating habits over the last year - My c reactive protein is high (3.5), my doctor says this means my body is inflamed? I have an appointment with a new doctor on Tuesday, as my old doctor just does not have the time to see me anymore. I am worried that the new doctor will just have me come back in a few months to check on the numbers again.

      "After 4 years on Synthroid I talked a new endo into trying Armour. I was so tired of not being able to lose 1 pound on the best behaviour and always being constipated! Well that was mid-April. At first I went through about 3 weeks of a REALLY BAD reaction - (although a big plus was suddenly my whole system was revved up and was FINALLY going #2 every day, metabolism in high gear and lost a few pounds) but - along with that I was SERIOUSLY hypo feeling, brain fog, felt AWFUL. But after that first few weeks the bad feeling went away and I felt GREAT - best I have felt since I was diagnosed. Well, of course, it couldn't last. This past week my energy levels have dropped off, feeling fatigued and can't really get in a good workout. My metabolism, however, is still good and I am still going to the bathroom every day (which is beyond fantastic). Anyone go through this when they switched? I wonder if I might need T4 added to my new Armour routine? Apparently the T3 in Armour is FINALLY helping my metabolism and the whole #2 problem! I had labs done about 4 weeks ago by my primary care (annual checkup) after I had been on Armour for a month already and the BAD side effects were just subsiding. My TSH had been around 1.5 for the last 4 years, so in just a short time my TSH went to .14 which I know is Hyper (I am assuming from the T3 in the Armour). TSH .14 T4 1.4 My endo is doing a full blood test w T3 next week. Also, my eosinophils were a little high this last blood test which I read could be from low cortisol - I think my adrenals were off during that 3 week horrible period when i first started Armour. I just don't want to give up on Armour because this is the first time I have gone to the bathroom right since I was diagnosed!\n",
      "I have been suffering from a few symptoms that i believe are due to underactive thyroid. The main one is fatigue - it is starting to interfere with my daily life. In addition to that, the texture of my hair has become extremely brittle/dry and breaks a lot, my tongue is swollen and scalloped, and my face is puffy. I have NOT had any weight gain though. I went to my regular doctor with this and she tested my TSH, T3 & T4. These are the results which she said are normal. I am considering making an appointment with an endocrinologist though because from what i have researched my numbers are borderline. Can someone please tell me, based on my results, whether or not it's worth making this appointment? TSH = 2.43 (range 0.178-4.530) T4 = 1.15 ng/dL (range 0.80-1.73) T3 = 270 pg/dL (i think this is 2.70 pg/mL when converted) - unfortunately there was no range for this one They are all within the ranges posted but to my understanding a TSH of >2 and a low T3/T4 are suspect.

      "Ive been under treatment for Hashimotos for over 10 years. For the last 2 years Ive had low BP (low for me; formerly 110/70, now low 90's over 40's) & heart rate (55 bpm-ish), and lethargy. My regular doctor sent me for a sleep study and stress test and to see a cardiologist. All that is normal. She thinks I should be on anti-depressants. My integrative NP and I met a few weeks ago and agreed all my symptoms are thyroid related and we upped my NatureThroid dose to 81.25 mg. Some historical labs: On 32.5 mg NatureThroid September 2015: TSH 3.79 (0.4-4.0) Free T4 1.02 (0.7-1.8) Free T3 263 (230-420) Anti ThyrPerox 196 (<60) Anti Thyroglob <15 (<60) On 48.75 mg NatureThroid June 2016: TSH 3.2 (0.4-4.0) Free T4 0.98 (0.7-1.8) Free T3 338 (230-420) Anti ThyrPerox 253 (<60) Anti Thyroglob <15 (<60) Most recently, on 65 mg NatureThroid March 2017 TSH 2.07 (0.4-4.0) Free T4 0.86 (0.7-1.8) Free T3 2.5 (2.3-5.01) Anti ThyrPerox 198 (<60) Anti Thyroglob <20 (<60) After a few days on the new dosage, I was feeling a bit more energetic. I spent all the new energy on bird walks and in the middle of the 2nd week I started feeling so lethargic Ive had to switch from walking the half mile from parking lot to job, to taking the shuttle. Is it normal to feel worse after increasing the dose? Ill get more blood work done in a few weeks but of course what really matters is how one feels, and I can hardly remember what its like to feel good. Also I note that the TSH number looks like its going in the right direction, but the T4 and T3 are not. I hope Im doing the right thing by increasing the NDT, and certainly my symptoms are hypo and not hyper, but I wonder if theres anything else I should be doing instead of increasing dose. My ferritin is fine, selenium and B12 fine, iodine is at the low end of the range so Im back on iodized salt. Havent checked Vitamin D in a while and that will be done next month, as will reverse T3. The literature Ive been reading about thyroid is very confusing. By the way my diet is good, plenty of protein, veg, moderate carbs (sweet potatoes, quinoa, some beans), very little sugar, GF, minimal dairy) and weight is 118 at 56. I have to watch the sugar or the weight starts to go up. Any idears? I really go back and forth about whether increased NDT is the right path since I just feel worse.\n",

      "Hi, I had a Partial Thyroidectomy this past February-2016. I wasn't put on medication as my levels have been in normal range. For the past month I've been feeling a warm/burning sensation throughout different parts of my body. I have some days where the symptoms are ok and others are awful. It feels like I have icy hot in different area's. The area's of the body also change. I've been keeping a log book of everything I eat. It seems like caffeine and alcohol intensifies these symptoms. I've been to so many doctors. It's not neurological as I've had catscans and MRI's to rule out tumor or nerve damage. It's been horrible. Has anyone ever had this experience?

      "So it's been a year since I started my search to answers for my condition... my some of my symptoms are: - fatigue - easily gain weight - mood swings - concentration issues - extreme muscle pain ( from waist down) including neuropathy like symptoms, burning, tingling... - numb feet - extreme to cold My mother, for the record, has hashimoto. Early this year I went to get blood work done to check for hashimoto to see if my fibromyalgia like symptoms were not hypothyroidism or hashimoto itself. my results were: - Thyroglobulin Antibody : <1.0 IU/mL - Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab: 18 IU/mL - T3, free, serum: 2.2 pg/mL - PTH, intact: 16 pg/ml - Cortisol, AM: 25.7 ug/dL - TSH: 1.310 uIU/mL -T4, free, Direct, S: 1.04 ng/dL - Calcium, Ionized, serum: 5.3 mg/dL My endocrinologist said I was COMPLETELY fine... although I have to say that the T3, TSH, and T4 in those labs are on the lower end of the range showed on the paper, and what I have learned ( in the internet...) is that OPTIMAL range is far from what these papers usually show, when comparing my results to what optimal ranges would be, I would actually have hypothyroidism. My calcium was also to the higher side and he blamed my slightly high vitamin d.. although I told him vitamind D ( I was taking 4,000 IU a day) was the only thing that was making me feel better.. he told me to stop. Since then, my symptoms have multiplied by 1000x... I feel so desperate, my body pains are insane, I can't even walk my dogs anymore. I have gone to a neurologist, did a 2hr glucose test, CPK, and aldolase to rule out any muscle problem and everything was fine. By the way I'm a bodybuilder and far from inactive ( or at least used to be.. ) now I can barely walk to the gym due to pains. I'm also now pretty much suffering from depression, which to be honest I'm not sure if it's due to the fact that I'm extremely frustrated with my situation or if it is because I actually am with hypothyroidism. I also had done an ultra sound of my thyroid and he said I had a very small node on one side that was too small to be considered an issue.. Hoping someone can give me some advice here to what could actually be going on. I've gone to so many doctors so far that is difficult to talk about everything in here. But I'm starting to not trust my doctors when telling me my numbers are fine when they are to the extreme lower side and considering that since them I have drastically gotten worse.

      "Hello everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read my post. So recently I went to the doctors, wasn't feel well. He ran a Thyroid ultrasound, and found a 4mm nodule, in addition he said that my thyroid was a little swollen. I went to an ENT, they did a nose/throat scope, said that my throat was inflamed due to GERD and sent me home. Over the past 2-3 weeks, I've had some gradual symptoms, the most noticable being mood change. In addition to mood changes, I've been experiencing waxing and waning symptoms that include joint pain, nausea, constipation (loose still), concentration and memory issues, low heart rate (sometimes 54 BPM, sometimes 68 BPM), and I almost fainted last night. In addition my face is getting swollen, and the right side of my neck is a little swollen too. When I had gone to my doctors previously, he had said my Thyroid was enlarged, which got me thinking that I may have a thyroid issue, that's throwing my bodies metabolism off. I'm really unsure what to do here, and when I called my doctor last week, he referred me to a psychiatrist! I haven't had any issues like that in years, so I'm wondering what it could be. If anyone has any suggestions, that'd be really helpful. I'm hoping that there's nothing serious going on, but I thought I'd ask anyhow. Thanks everyone!\n",
      "Hello...i have not been on this message board for many years. Anyway i have been having issues with thyroid levels just lately. My tsh bottom out about 6 months ago and i was on armour 120 mcgs for many years. We kept reducing one pill a week to try to get it up a bit. I feel better between 1 and 2. I was at 120 5 days a week and still not coming up. By the way i am 61 dx'd at 18. So we dropped way down to 1 grain (60 mg). Will get retested in 6 weeks. Ft4 is low and having her check ft3 next round. I don't want to monkey around with reverse etc. I guess my question is when you are on armour and t3 is good how do you get the t4 up at least in range? Also how many of you split your dose twice daily? Thanks Sandi\n",
      "Hi all, A couple of months ago I felt a lump in my neck and my doctor sent me for an ultrasound which showed multinodular goiter with 6 nodules. The largest is 5cmx2cm. It showed no trachea deviation. This week I had a CT on my spine which incidentally showed the goiter now with posterior extension adjacent to esophagus and trachea deviation to the right. I am not on any medication. The latest blood test results are: TSH 2.5 (0.4-4) Free T3 4.3 (3.5-6.5) Free T4 18.1 (9.8-18.8) Reverse T3 544 (230-540) RT3:FT3 Ratio 7.9 (<20) TG - Ab 11.9 (<60) TSH Receptor Anti <1 (<1.5) TPO - Ab 16.5 (<60) Thyroglobulin 213 (1.6-50) Anti Thyroglobulin <1 (<5) I mainly want to know what the CT means.. Is it likely I'll need to have it removed as it is clearly still growing. And with the blood test results, why would Thyroglobulin be so high? And T4 is high yet T3 is low. Any reason for that? Thanks for any help Andrea\n",

      "Which NDT is better: \"Nature-Throid\" or \"US Armour Thyroid?\" I probably do NOT need over 1/2 grain of NDT (Naturally dessicated thyroid) = 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. At most, probably, 3/4 grain NDT = 75 mcg Levo]. Started taking \"Thyroid Support Supplement\" (by 1 Body) and want to do in combination with a Thyroid med. Absolutely can NOT stand LEVO anymore. Tried \"Thyroid Support\" (by 1 Body) with LEVO and couldn't stand it. When I use the \"Thyroid support\" (by 1 Body) by itself [only 1 time daily in AM] I do NOT have the BAD reactions, but I know I probably need a med, also, and not just support. I have taken LEVO for 4 years and can NOT stand the \"detached\" feeling (brain fog) anymore, nor the bad feelings. (Started with 25 mcg in 2013 and moved up to 50, 75 and 88 mcg recently.) In May, 2013, my TSH was 10.17 and then down to 9.87 in June, 2014. Then started taking \"US Armour Thyroid\" 90 mg (= 1.5 grains) and TSH went down to 0.06. Then 9-2014, the Doctor switched me to Levothyroxine 25 mcg and TSH stayed around 2.0 for 6 months or longer. Then doctor started raising LEVO (as I was feeling fatigue) to 50, 75 and last 3 years.

      "Hello everybody, I'm brand new to this forum, but I'm hoping that someone can help me out! I am a 24 year old female, and recently went to the doctor's for depression/extreme fatigue, combined with amenorrhea (no period for four months). I'd always been pretty high energy and an all-around positive person, and enjoyed being social and going out with friends frequently. However, since about two months ago, things have definitely taken a turn. It was gradual in the beginning; I started feeling constantly exhausted no matter how much sleep I got, and couldn't think as quickly and multitask at work. As the days went by, things got worse, as I went on to fall into full-on depression. I started to call in sick to work that I used to enjoy, and now I don't even feel like going out to see my friends. It feels like there is a constant mental haze that's blocking me from being back to my usual self. I also keep gaining weight even though I a) have almost no appetite, b) eating healthy when I do, and c) exerting the very little energy I have in me to hit the gym. When I got my blood work done, my TSH panel was as follows: TSH: 0.97 (0.32-5.04) mU/L T4 Free: 10.5 (10.6-19.7) pmol/L T3 Free 3.78 (3.00-5.90) pmol/L My guess is that I'm showing signs of hypothyroidism, but these numbers are confusing me. Even though my T4 Free is low, my TSH is as well, which is the opposite of most hypothyroid individuals. Moreover, even though my T4 Free is low, somehow my T3 free is in range. Could anybody be able to help me decipher what these numbers mean? I don't even feel like myself anymore, and it's making me more and more depressed by the day. Please help! PS: I did struggle with anorexia nervosa and BED in my past, but I am now fully recovered. Having that been said, this weight gain is definitely causing a lot of stress; recovery hasn't been easy, and this is pushing my limits as my self-image is starting to plummet again. Could this stress be a contributor?\n",

      "So I am a 25 year old girl who started noticing significant hair loss around the age of 15/16. Not only that, but the quality and texture of my hair changed completely. My individual strands always used to be fine and slightly wavy, but my hair was extremely thick overall and shiny. Now, my hair has become brittle, wild, full of split ends, untamable and I have lost probably 75% of my hair allover my scalp. It looks like the worst possible clinical presentation of hypothyroidism. My mother developed hypothyroidism in pregnancy and has developed worse hair loss and change in texture than I have. But she didn't develop this until she was 30 years old and pregnant. The men on my dad's side of the family have male pattern baldness, but the women on my dad's side have perfect hair and my brother has perfect hair. I have always gotten my TSH, and total T4 and T3, iron, and androgen levels checked each year and they have always been normal. But this year, I decided to ask the doctor to check my thyroid antibodies, reverse T3, and free T3 as well. We discovered that my free T3 was 1 point above the upper limit. My TSH as always, was closer to the lower limit of normal. I don't understand how I could have lost so much hair and have it completely transform in terms of quality and texture. And technically, despite being at the lower end of normal, my TSH is still normal, so I can't even be diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I really do not understand what happened to my hair. I use rogaine on the top half of my scalp, but I don't think it has helped that much. I just wish I could feel like a normal person. I am not asking for that perfect hair that I once had. I am just asking to feel normal and as if I can go out in public without having to straighten it each time. I also don't want to get to the point where I have no more hair at all, especially at such a young age. I don't know anyone else who has gone through the same thing.\n",

      "Hi, I have MNG which was diagnosed in 2014 by my endocrinologist which I have been seeing for many years for a different condition. She felt my neck, after describing some bizarre symtoms I had experienced a week prior, after returning from an overseas trip. Anyway, she felt my thyroid and it was nodulated. She decided to watch and wait and finally ordered an U/S in early 2016. My lab results are all in normal range and still are. Although I was a little bit iodine deficient and told me to start taking iodine supplement. Last year's U/S reported, 5 nodules: R) side: lobe the upper limit of normal size. 8ml. Single solid nodule 1.5cm mid pole. Single focus of calcification in lower lobe, 3mm. L) side Enlarged lobe. 13ml. Marginally increased vascularity. Midpole, 3cm solid echogenic nodule. Lower pole, 1.1cm + 7mm nodules both showing microcalcification. I had FNAs done on the three biggest nodules, including the dominant L) side nodule that was also cold on the Nuclear report. All were benign. This year- exactly a year after, I had another U/S done by a different sonographer at the same practice. 8 nodules It shows: R) side Enlarged. 9ml. Upper pole, solid 2mm nodule Midpole, solid 6mm (did it shrink in size?) Lower pole solid 1.1cm nodule. The calcification increased to 4mm. L) side. Enlarged at 11ml. Upper pole, 2.6cm solid nodule. Midpole,1.3cm solid nodule (??? Did it shrink?) Lower pole, 2.5cm, 1.7cm and 1.9cm. All solid A few questions: Do nodules increase in size or appear rapidly in a year like this, and do they equally shrink just as quick, as in the case of the 1.5cm nodule, and the 3cm hypoechoic nodule? Also, do microcalifications in nodules disappear? Or is that a discrepancy between what sonographers saw. Do thyroid sizes fluctuate year to year? Thanks\n",
      "Back in 2014 I had some issues that were sudden with my thyroid. I would feel it throbbing and feeling like television fuzz in there ( please tell me you can understand that LOL). I went to my doc ( we lived in WNY at this time) and he sent me for a u/s of my thyroid and neck. My left side lobe was much larger than my right and had a solid tiny 2mm nodule. All my labs were perfect so he started me on low dose synthroid 75mg. I've been on that dose since. Later that year I felt like my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling. I was sent to hema/onco and they did a ton of blood work and everything came back perfect...my labs are always pristine. The oncologist said my lymph nodes were fine and sent me on my way. I felt like crap, tired, headaches, neck pain, shortness of breath ( I was also prescribed an inhaler at this point), hoarse voice, face flushing, dry coarse hair, lizard skin, sometimes difficulty swallowing, dizziness, the worst memory ever in the world, joint pains, and no energy. In 2016 my PCP sent me to an Endo and he did blood work and told me that my pituitary gland wasn't working. He repeated the tests and said the same and then sent me a letter in the mail saying he was closing his office. I should mention that he also had a u/s ordered and my lobes came back fine, no left side swelling, but my solid nodule was 3mm. Summer of 2016 we moved from WNY to Az and I established a PCP who I brought my records to and by this time, September, I'm having flushed face daily and this chronic low grade fever. He treats me for a UTI I don't have and tells me not to worry about my nodes, my thyroid, and my low grade fever is common so stop checking it and just forget about it. Yeah. I got really sick day after Christmas and went to him and said that I was worse. He said I \"Looked\" fine and to come back in two weeks. Tired of him blowing me off I found an ENT here and made an appointment with him. In the mean time waiting for that appointment, my new PCP office calls and his front desk girl says he closed his doors and if I wanted my records to come pick them up...sense a theme here? LOL I pick them up and my last 3 visits he doesn't even mention my complaints. SO I see the ENT and he happens to have a GP Resident with him and she feels my one swollen lymph node and he doesn't. I explain what's been going on and by now I've had this dry cough since right after Christmas ( I also saw a ID doc right before seeing this ENT on my own) and they order blood work and another u/s of my thyroid and lymph nodes. She also took my hand and promised me we would figure this out, and she took me on as a new patient. So my u/s came back with 8 swollen lymph nodes in both sides of my neck ... Left side: 1 (1.1 x 0.5 x 0.7cm) 2 ( 1. x 0.4 x 0.6 cm ) 3. (0.5 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm ) 4. ( 1.4 x 0.5 x 1.0 cm ) 5. (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm) 6 (2.6 x 5.6 x 1.8 cm and has an abnormal cortex ) Right side: 1 ( 1.3 x 0.4 x 1 cm) 2 ( 1.4 x 0.6 x 1.4 cm) Left side nodule in the midpole measured at 4 x 2.9 x4.5 mm and is now complex. I have an appointment with a surgeon next week to discuss options. I'm a little uneasy as I don't have an established Endo here and it won't be until August that I can get in ( Never ever move to Yuma Az LOL). I don't know if they should take all the nodes and my left lobe, or just the nodes, or what. The ENT suggested just doing a core needle biopsy on one node...yeah, that'll tell them what's going on with that one nodule but not the other 7. I know the nodule is small but it has been changing even being on Synthroid. I'm just looking for any \"suggestions\", I know I probably can't seen medical advice here, but being in the dark and my surgery consult next week worries me. Also, I've read about mapping...how do they do that for the lymph nodes? My doc has discussed thyroid cancer with me and lymphoma so I'm aware of possibilities. I worked in a lab for years so I get some stuff but def not all. Any thoughts would be appreciated\n",

      "Hello, I'm a 22 year old female who was recently diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism and Graves Disease. Ive come to believe that I've been dealing with this disease for over 8 years now but my thyroid hormone levels have just recently been tested, which is unbelievable to me considering the following. Let's start when I was 14, grade A student, motivated, happy. Came down suddenly with chronic depression and was unable to gain weight, my family doc at the time even told me I was on the verge of annorexia, which was baffling to me considering I ate constantly. Fast forward to when I was 18, my first visit with an endocrinologist due to inability to have a period and severe depression. He diagnosed me with PCOS after taking tests on my testosterone/progesterone/estrogen levels, and because I declined an internal ultrasound we were never 100% positive I actually had cysts, just the symptoms. After progesterone supplements and some prediabetic medicine I had started my period but CONTINUED to feel severely ill and depressed after that. I'm very prideful so I thought me feeling \"ill\" was simply because of my depression, and I hated being seen as weak or as a victim, so I kept most of it to myself and basically kept my mother updated solely on my depression. Here I am now, 22, and I finally decided this past week to go to the docs and get put on antidepressants and counseling due to my depression, as I have recently been sleeping through multiple alarms and feeling tired/ill constantly at work. This is the first job/career to mean a lot to me so it was something I really didn't want to mess up. My doctor decided on a whim to test my thyroid levels as well and they came back remarkably high, diagnosing me with hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease. I'm wondering though, feeling ill and fatigued and depressed for so long(with dry puffy eyes showing up about twice a year for the past 8 years) have I really gone 8 years living with Graves' disease? If so, which isn't completely possible, what am I at risk for? Could there be something severely wrong with my thyroid at this point? Am I likely to get heart disease/heart palpations or anything of that sort? Would love to hear any responses/opinions. I'm still going through testing so I'll keep everyone updated on how that goes as well and how severe this is!\n",

      "Backstory: Mom had hyperthyroid, now hypo Me - started out with panic attacks in mid 20s, have increased exponentially in the last 6 years to the point I can't function day to day currently. I got my official Hashimotos diagnosis because the antibody levels were so high, but my TSH levels vary from normal to wildly at either end of the spectrum. You all know the drill with anxiety and thyroid. My problem is at where I am right now. I just moved back across the country and was inbetween insurance so my meds fell off, I'm seeing a brand new doctor who insisted on running all the usual tests before confirming anything and not wanting to bother getting records from my old GP. I called him up after my blood results were what I expected and all but demanded he just put me back on the dose I was at with Synthyroid (175mcg) so I could hopefully stop suffering inbetween the LONG waits inbetween appointments. Problem is, the thryoid meds aren't helping and my issues are still compounding and I don't see him again for 3 weeks. I've been dealing with the panic attacks since the beginning, I know that they're not outright going to kill me and I can generally talk myself out of them during the day. The problem is the frequency they're occurring during the night. We're talking 3-4 on a good day and 10-15 on a bad one. I have not slept a night through in over a year. I took one of my husband's ambien and apparently still got up and had panic attacks and did a bunch of weird crap but then just have no recollection of it. Xanax sort of helps but not really, and I'm out and I don't think I can demand another drug off my new doctor until I see him again. This long, ongoing inability to sleep is starting to affect my job as I literally cannot stay awake during the mornings no matter how hard I try, which leads to a snowballing effect of the fear of nodding off is causing me to have more daytime panic attacks. It's gotten to the point where I seriously fear losing my job because of sleeping and overall just the paralyzing inability to do anything because simple tasks set off panic attacks. Another new symptom that's only just recently crept up within the last few months but is also undoubtedly getting worse by the day is when I am struck by these daytime panic attacks I am losing all control of my bladder. It's not even like \"omg I have to go\". The attack hits, brain fog rolls in, brain fog rolls out, oh look, I've wet myself completely. On the worst of days this has literally happened to me 3-4 times in one day. I'm running out of underwear, and it's seriously damaging to my self-esteem that A: my husband knows this is happening and has had to cleanup after me and B: he's seriously suggesting that I as a 31 year old invest in incontinence supplies. I'm seriously struggling to find the road forward. I have a hard time getting anyone including my doctor to understand how serious these symptoms have become. I don't know why medication doesn't seem to be helping anymore. If I have to keep waiting for care I feel like I am going to drop dead. I have literally felt my heart stop during some of these episodes. I feel like this is beyond \"normal\" (I know, none of it is normal) anxiety, because nothing I read about seems to portray the level at which I feel I am at. Has anyone dealt with this to this extent? Do you have any quick fixes for surviving to the next doctor's appointment? I need help.\n",

      "Hello, I reduced my dose from 75 micro grams to 50 micro grams because I was trying to reduce pain in my legs and knees. I noticed my resting heart beat could be slightly fast and my anxiety was bad. This was about two weeks ago but now, I still have the leg pain. Anxiety isn't as bad but I'm now really tired. I'm going to go back to 75 Micro grams from tomorrow (26/4/17). I'm not sure either dose is correct for me. In the UK, the usual brand of levo has been changed. I wonder if that will help or make it worse. Thanks, Martyn\n",
      "Hi Guys, I came across this forum the other day when I developed a strange crackling noise in my chest, which comes and goes. I read a large number of personal stories regarding thyroid problems and must say that apart from the above problem which seems to be improving, I was stunned that most of my other problems are thyroid related. Also sad to read so many people struggling. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 12 or more years ago, I cannot remember. At times it has gone overactive and my dose has been adjusted. I believe I have suffered from depression and a bad temper since I was very young. My father has an underachieve thyroid and also has a monthly injection of vitamin B12. He has, as I have abused alcohol as a form of self medication. Nobody will have anything to do within apart from myself and my stepmother as he goes into violent verbal rages. I never made the association before I came to this forum. I have always had problems with extreme emotional outbursts, obviously worse when I have been drinking. Sorry for the rambling, but I joined AA about 16 years ago and to cut a long story short, eventually managed 6 1/2 years of sobriety. But I still suffered from extreme anxiety. I had been subscribed Zoloft AD. Which I was on for about 7 years, along with xanax. Gradually during this time my anxiety became crippling, along with weight gain. I was forced to abandon my business as it became impossible for me to drive. This was about 6 years ago. I was still not drinking but felt awful. Someone suggested I went into a private clinic, I stayed in for 5 weeks during which I completed a cognitive therapy course, it did not help very much. They also tried to teach me to meditate which sent me into a severe anxiety attack every time. I came out of there drugged up to the eyeballs of 7 different types of medication, the Dr often changed them on a daily basis. I felt shocking, more anxious than ever. So rather foolishly I decided to quit all the drugs cold turkey, definitely not to be recommended. After 5 weeks of hell I could FEEL, even the breeze on my arms. But these feelings where so overwhelming, I felt so depressed. So after much consideration and consultation with my husband I decided to try drinking again. This was fine for a while, but gets out of hand quite often. The most amazing thing for me is the discovery that the anxiety attacks and depression are linked to my thyroid disease. I had absolutely no idea.I could ramble on and on, but one thing which I have proven to myself is that taking certain vitamins particularly B's have helped me and also after stopping my daily dose of Apple Cider Vinegar when we were away earlier this year, caused me so much muscle pain that I could barely walk. It got better almost immediately when I resumed it. I have changed my diet dramatically but still find I have the energy of a slug. And am so frightened of driving more people away with my hideous emotional abuse. What I would like to know, is have any of you had any success in curing your problem with diet and vitamins through a homeopathic Dr? I have read that this is possible, but I have my doubts. If anyone has not fallen asleep with boredom, thank you for reading this.\n",
      "I had hyper, did radiation 6x, hypo then found out I have Graves Disease. I tried Synthoid but it was horrible. The taste of chemicals every day was the worst. So I tried Thyroid.

      "So my wife has had a disorder that's gone untreated for 30 years, since she was in grade school she's had dry flaky skin, extreme fatigue, sensitivity to cold, constipation, coarse dry hair, depression and so on. We assumed Hashimoto's due to the symptoms, and over the last month she has developed a painful goiter which is sore and makes it difficult to swallow. she also has a family history of Thyroid conditions, her sister had a portion of her thyroid removed due to papillary cancer and a large nodule on her thyroid. My wife just had an ultra sound which showed a swollen thyroid multiple nodules on both sides. Her doctor (not an endo) determined that they didn't appear to be cancerous. Her labs came back showing low TSH and none of the TPO's which lead her doctor to say it wasn't hashimoto's. the lab failed to do the T3/T4 testing even though they were requested so we have to go back in to get those labs done. This is all we know at this point and we are getting a bit nervous as to what the cause is, and we're constantly speculating because we know just enough to be worried but not enough to completely pin down what the issue could be. I'm assuming Secondary Hypo due to the low TSH and because her symptoms point to a hypo condition, is that a safe guess? or am I putting the cart before the horse without knowing the T3/T4 levels? She's never exhibited any symptoms of hyperthyroid, it's always been hypo. and her symptoms are pretty severe, her dry flaky skin is the worst, followed by her dyr hair, then fatigue and mood swings, she also has menstrual issues where she has little to no period and it's never consistent month to month. Her thyroid just recently started growing and is becoming a painful nuisance. my only guess is that due to her symptoms she's not creating enough thyroid horomones because her pituitary isn't producing enough TSH. we were completely shocked to hear a no to Hashimoto's because everything fits, is it possible to have it with low TSH and no signs of TPO? I've also looked into a lot of other possibilities like cushings and other Adrenal disorders but can't find anything that's as close a match to her hypo symptoms. any guidance is appreciated.\n",
      "I would really appreciate any help and advice! For over 2 years now I have been having they symptoms of hypothyroidism that have increasingly becoming worse ... loss of periods, severe fatigue, depression, weight gain that I cannot lose despite exercise and healthy eating / seriously cutting calories, puffy face, intolerance to the cold, hair loss ... the list goes on. I have been to the doctors so many times and I am met with the usual response ... I am stressed or depressed. I went along these lines and have done everything they have suggested .. antidepressants, therapy, Cbt, healthy eating and exercise. None of which have worked. The antidepressants made me feel worse and sometimes I am so tired I can barely walk let alone exercise! My blood test results keep coming back 'normal' ... my tsh result is low and my free t4 and t3 have been below the recommended guidelines, however recent blood tests show that my t4 has raised within the normal range but my t3 is still below. Deep down I really feel this is related to hypothyroidism. I'm literally don't recognise myself physically or mentally anymore and I do not know what to do. I'm sick of feeling like this. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice / similar stories as to whether this could be a thyroid issue and if I should push this further with my doctors and what I should ask they should do? Or should I give up and just accept this is the way I am or that they are right? Any advice and help would be really appreciated!\n",

      "Hi, I have recently been diagnosed with multinodular goiter, the largest nodule is solid and cold - 5cm x 2cm although it may have grown since the initial ultrasound, as I can definitely feel it more now, pressure in neck (especially when lying down), swallowing difficulties etc. Another is 3.8cm x 1.4cm and the rest around 2cm. I am not currently medicated and TSH fluctuates from around 1 to around 3, FT3 has only been checked once so far and was 4.8 (3.5-6.5) and FT4 was slightly high at 20.6 (9.8-18.8). Not sure why FT4 is high when FT3 is lower than mid range. The FNA off the biggest nodule came back as benign follicular nodule with copious thin colloid, haemosiderin-laden and foamy macrophages and hurthle cell change. Just wondering if anyone has any insight in this FNA, as I read some type of cancer cant be diagnosed by FNA and this might include follicular nodules and hurthle cells? Thanks Andrea\n",

      "Hi there everyone. I am a 21 y/o female with a previous autoimmune disease (autoimmune ovarian failure) when I was 14 or 15. So far, all of my routine labs since diagnosis have come back negative for any other signs of autoimmune problems, which I am fortunate for. However, the past month I have been feeling generally ill. Fatigue (just feeling \"worn out\"), some slight weight gain (slowly... about 3-4lbs over the past few months, but I don't feel I'm eating more), headaches, lightheadness/dizziness, some mild nausea, general malaise. My blood pressure has also been low - 90/55 and 84/60 being my previous two readings. I called my endocrinologist to tell her and she wanted me to go get some labs done and send the results to her. I did, among other things (that all came back normal) I had my TSH and T4 tested. My TSH was 2.5, which doesn't seem alarming, but my TSH as of 6 mos ago was 1.3. My T4, however, was 0.57. (Ref 0.62 to 1.3 or so?) When I talked to my endocrinologist about it, she said she wasn't particularly over-concerned about my TSH and T4, but that my T4 has been on a general downward trend the last two labs prior, and my TSH is on a general upward trend. She said given my symptoms that she is going to have me come in a few weeks from now to test my T4 and TSH again, and look for antithyroid antibodies. I am just curious if it would make sense that this is explaining my symptoms, and if I'm likely looking at hashimoto's. I figure I can just have underactive thyroid, but since I have an autoimmune disease already, could be possible. I have also been peeing like it's my job. I have had to urinate essentially every hour or so on the hour since I woke up this morning. I am not sure if that's related but it's SUPER annoying.\n",

      "Hi, there- Just seeking some input on whether or not to keep pushing for additional testing regarding my thyroid labs. As some background: I saw my primary last fall for thinning hair, fatigue, and feeling cold all the time (my body temp is often 96.5-97.9 - rarely ever gets above 98). Anyhow, my primary doc ran a bunch of labs and results showed a normal TSH but low normal free t3 and t4 as follows: TSH: 1.614 (0.350 - 5.000 mcUnits/mL) Free T3: 2.3 ( 2.2 - 4.0 pg/mL ) Free T4: 0.8 (0.8 - 1.5 ng/dL) My RBC was also a little low at 3.85 mil/mcL 4.00 - 5.20 mil/mcL, so she thought that might explain some of my symptoms. She did go back and check my thyroid antibodies, which were normal as follows: THYROID PEROXIDASE A 47 Units/mL ( <60 Units/mL) Thyroglobulin Antibody <0.9 IU/mL (0.0 - 4.0 IU/mL ) Several months have passed since these tests and I've been taking an iron supplement, but don't feel any better. My hair remains thin and seems to be shedding more by the day, I'm about 7 lbs. up from my normal weight despite the fact that I am a long distance runner and eat well & exercise regularly. I'm not exactly a spring chicken at 43 and I do work with young, special needs children so I'm on my feet much of the day, but I just never expected to feel so tired all the time at this age - some nights, I beat my 11 year old to bed. I'm starting to feel like a hypochondriac and am a bit embarrassed to go back and ask for more tests, or what tests I would even ask for at this point. So anyhow, just wondering if anything about my labs looks troublesome, or should I drop the thyroid angle and move on? Thanks for any thoughts.\n",

      "Clinical History: Multinodular goiter with several nodules larger than 1 cm in diameter. For follow-up. Comparison: 3/10/2016 Technique: Real time ultrasonic evaluation of the thyroid gland was performed and the obtained static images and real time cine clips were then presented to me for formal interpretation Findings: Each lobe is slightly longer than can be included on a single longitudinal image which limits determination of their exact length. With this in mind, the right lobe measures at least 5.3 cm in length. It measures 1.2 x 2 cm an AP and transverse dimensions, respectively. The left lobe measures slightly longer than 5.3 cm in length and 1.8 x 3.1 cm in AP and transverse dimensions. The thyroid isthmus measures up to 4.5 mm in thickness. Numerous nodules are seen within the thyroid gland. These are as follows: RIGHT LOBE: 1. Posterior aspect upper pole: Solid, mildly heterogeneous, hypoechoic nodule which is best seen and measured on the cine clip obtained transversely through the right lobe on which it measures 6 x 8 mm an AP and transverse dimensions. It is not optimally visualized on the sagittal images. With this limitation in mind, it measures approximately 7 mm in length. This was measured at 8.5 x 5 x 6 mm on the previous exam. 2. Posteromedial aspect upper pole just inferior to that described in #1: A nodule with 2 different components or 2 nodules immediately adjacent to each other. The cystic component located superiorly which is anechoic except for a single tiny bright area of echogenicity consistent with colloid crystal measures 5 x 4 x 5 mm. This was measured at 6 x 3.5 x 5 mm on the previous exam. The solid, mildly heterogeneous hypoechoic nodule seen adjacent to the posteroinferior aspect of the cyst measures 11 x 4 x 6.5 mm. This measured 12 x 7 x 8 mm on the previous exam. 3. Medial aspect upper pole: A solid, mildly heterogeneous nodule seen anterior to the solid component of the nodule described in #2 measuring 10 x 4.5 x 7 mm. There was not a similar nodule seen in this region of the medial aspect of the right lobe on the previous exam. A nodule seen at the same level of the right lobe but more laterally on the previous exam which had a cystic component superiorly and a solid, heterogeneous component more inferiorly overall measured 13 x 5 x 8 mm on the previous exam. The solid component of this nodule on the previous exam measured 8 x 5 x 7 m. 4. Lateral aspect upper pole: A cyst measuring 10 x 10 x 9 mm. It contains a solid component within its inferior aspect which measures 4 x 4 x 5 mm. On the previous exam, this was seen as a hypoechoic area measuring 9 x 5 x 10 mm. The increase in the AP dimension on this exam is related to an interval increase in the amount of fluid contained within the cyst on this exam. The solid component seen within the inferior aspect of this area was not as clearly delineated on the sagittal images on the previous exam but it is seen on the transverse images from the previous exam on which it measures 4 mm in both AP and transverse dimensions. 5. Lateral aspect upper to mid right lobe: A 10 x 9 x 10 mm in size solid, heterogeneous nodule containing a couple small cystic spaces adjacent to the inferior aspect of the nodule described in #4. This demonstrates blood flow at its periphery on the available color Doppler images. This measured 9 x 7.5 x 10.5 mm on the previous exam. 6. Anteromedial aspect mid right lobe: A 5 x 3 x 4 mm in size heterogeneous, predominantly solid, hypoechoic nodule with small cystic spaces seen adjacent to the inferomedial aspect of the nodule described in #5. This contains blood flow at its medial aspect on color Doppler. This measured 5 x 2.5 x 4 mm on the previous exam 7. Lateral aspect mid right lobe: A 5 mm in all 3 dimensions predominantly solid, hypoechoic nodule containing a couple of small cystic spaces adjacent to the inferior aspect of the nodule described in #5 and and just medial to the nodule described in #6. This measured 4.5 x 4 x 5.5 mm the previous exam. It demonstrates internal blood flow on color Doppler evaluation. 8. Posteromedial aspect mid right lobe: Similar predominantly solid hypoechoic nodule with small cystic spaces measuring 5 x 3 x 5 mm compared with 4.5 x 2.5 x 5 mm on the previous exam. 9. Lower pole: A 17 x 12 x 13.5 mm in size predominantly cystic nodule. This measured 16 x 11 x 12 mm on the previous exam. There is again seen to contain a mildly thickened internal septation and a triangular-shaped area of soft tissue echogenicity involving its inferior aspect which is similar in appearance to the previous exam. An additional small soft tissue nodular component seen towards its posteromedial aspect measuring 1.5 mm in diameter is new. 10. Lower pole: Homogeneously hyperechoic nodule within or immediately adjacent to the inferior tip of the right lobe measuring 6 x 4.5 x 5.5 mm. This measured 5.5 x 3.5 x 6 mm on the previous exam. 11. There are a few additional hypoechoic nodules or cysts within the right lobe all measuring less than 4 mm in greatest dimension. RIGHT SIDE OF THE THYROID ISTHMUS: 1. 8.5 x 5 x 8 mm in size solid hypoechoic nodule which contains small cystic spaces. This demonstrates blood flow along the posterior aspect of its right side on color Doppler. This measured 9 x 5.5 x 7.5 mm on the previous exam. 2. A 6.5 x 4 x 5 mm in size cyst more inferiorly located than #1. This measured 3 x 4.5 mm in AP and transverse dimensions on the previous exam. Mild soft tissue thickening along its anterior aspect measuring approximately 1 mm in thickness was similarly present on the previous exam. LEFT LOBE: 1. The left lobe is again seen to be essentially replaced by a conglomeration of cystic and solid nodules which are measured as 2 large mixed cystic and solid nodules which demonstrate blood flow at their periphery as well as within some of the solid components. That located superiorly measures approximately 31 x 15 x 27 mm. This was measured at 31 x 17 x 25 mm on the previous exam. The lower pole component measures approximately 24 x 16 x 18 mm compared with 22 x 16 x 15 mm on the previous exam. 2. A few additional sub-4 mm in size hypoechoic and cystic nodules are seen in the medial aspect of the left lobe and the left-sided thyroid isthmus.\n",
      "Hi, really glad to have found this board bc I am going crazy with trying to do something about this hypothyroid mess. I was first on synthroid, did labs again a few weeks ago and my Endo put me on armour. The armour made me extremely dizzy and anxious but I kept trying to push through...didn't work. Through lots of reading and research I called me Endo and asked to be placed on Nature Throid. I have the 16.25 tablets and this is day three. I am sooooo depressed and lethargic. Thinking about doubling it up to see it it feels better. Any suggestions?\n",
      "Has anyone ever had severe muscle spasms due to taking medications for hypothyroidism? I was given all types of meds for a low thyroid level and suffered severe muscle spasms all over my body. I stopped taking the meds but the spasms never left. I first got the spasms about an hour after taking the first pill and have had them long after stopping. The Doctors are stumped. No one can tell what happened especially since my thyroid is now normal yet I am cramped every where. The only drug that helps is clonazapam and they are taking that away. I am lowering the dose now and the cramps are coming back with a vengeance.\n",
      "Hello everyone, I'm 29 years old and I've been suffering for over 4 years of these following symptoms: fatigue, sensitivity to light, headaches, dizziness, brain fog, poor concentration, muscle aches, no libido, heavy periods, neck pain, anxiety, clumsiness, low basal body temperature (between 95.7 and 96.5 degrees Fahrenheit), blurred vision, impaired memory, etc..I've seen many many doctors and therapist and couldn't find anything or couldn't help me. The only thing that makes me feel better is when the temperature drops outside ( below 23 degrees Fahrenheit). 2 days ago I did some blood tests and my TSH is 3.56. My GP said it is in the normal range. However I read on many websites that the ideal TSH levels should be between 1 and 1.5, and over 3 you have hypothyroidism (even the website of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists says that). I'm wondering if someone else here has or had a TSH over 3 and is under treatment for hypothyroidism. Thank you very much!\n",
      "About 6 hours post thyroidectomy...very swollen, bruised, and painful. Upon the review of my ultrasound, it was determined that I had 3 large nodules almost 2cm each and my thyroid was about 3 times normal size. Once the doctor started my surgery, he found that my thyroid was wrapped around my esophagus and was practically choking me. This explained the pressure and choking feeling I would have from time to time. My incision is double the length that the doctor was expecting to cut in order for the large nodular gland to be removed. Now that the surgery so over and I am recovering, there is more pressure than ever and it is difficult to swallow. Couching is by far the worst...do any of you have any advice on how to make this better? I am on pain killers and calcium which I have to crush in order to ingest. I had talked to others that have had this surgery and from what they had said, I did not plan to be in this much pain. Having a few other surgeries in my past, I felt I knew what to expect at some extent but this is worse than I had imagined. I am having trouble going to sleep because of all the pain and pressure. When should I expect relief and does anyone have any advice? In the morning, I will post another picture to compare to this one taken right after I was released from hospital.\n",
      "Hi, I'm new here and new to hyperthyroidism, diagnosed almost 4 weeks ago. About 6 months ago I suffered two, for me, huge stress events, one at work and one personal. Only one has been resolved but even it left doubts and anxieties beyond what I knew was normal for me. Any way my world as I knew it imploded and left me a physical and emotional wreck. My weight dropped from 68kg to 51kg, I would force myself to exercise but found I had to rest many times and would often have tears pouring down my cheeks, I couldn't eat and suffered what I now recognise as hunger pains (a tight band just under my ribs and pains referred into my chest). I thought I was just being stupid and was secretly convinced I had bipolar (like my mum). I was angry and upset, had headaches, feelings of low self worth and was worried about peoples motives and actions, add to that my pulse started to pound and, when alone, though I felt like there was something I should be doing, I couldn't muster the motivation to do it and my brain wouldn't shut down. It eventually got so bad I laughingly mentioned to my work mates that I thought I was having a nervous breakdown or a midlife crisis, luckily for me the GP who has a clinic at my hospital (I'm a registered nurse) also heard me and started asking questions. He ordered blood tests which I had done the next day and I saw him for the results the day after, they were as follows: free T4 19.1 (range 9.0 to 19.0) TSH 1.33 (range 0.4 to 4.0) my colorectal tumour marker(CEA) was high at 10 and both my ESR and CRP (they measure inflammation) were raised. The thyroid to me was the least of my worries, I was more concerned that I might have metastatic cancer which seemed to fit my picture perfectly, however my doctor said my CEA could be raised through smoking (restarted when stressed)and my irritable bowel syndrome. He did however test me for those things but his main focus was my thyroid for which he gave me carbimazole initially 10mg morning, 5mg lunch and 10mg night. I went to a female doctor for a PAP smear and she agreed that my CEA was most likely irrelevant and certainly not a concern. I asked my doctor why he thought it was thyroid when my T4 was only just outside normal limits and my TSH was normal and he explained that the results in conjunction with my symptoms (BP 138/100 when normal for me was 90/50 and pulse of 125 when normally it sat on 70 plus all the weight and emotional issues) led him to believe I was thyrotoxic. Fast forward two very unpleasant weeks and all screening showed no evidence of cancer and thyroid results of free T4 of 17.1 TSH 0.06. I was concentrating on the T4 levels as that is the thing that gives the symptoms and I hoped the doc would reduce my carbimazole as my platlets had dropped just below normal and I was experiencing joint and muscle pains, but he increased it because my pulse was still over 100 (work =stress=raised pulse) even though most of my other symptoms had become mostly manageable. I had been pinning my hopes on reducing doses and a return to normal thyroid function as to me the drop in my TSH meant that my pituitary had finally realised that my T4 was raised and had responded, as it was meant to, by negative feedback. Alas no one else agreed with me and to back them up my mood plummeted but not as bad as before I was medicated. Yesterday was a good day I was meant to have a biopsy of a lymph gland in my neck but they rechecked it and said it didn't need it so I will have another ultrasound in 2 months just to make sure it hasn't changed, I resolved a longstanding dispute over a faulty oven and life was good, today was not so good with a friend not talking to me leaving me crying and deressed. It helps to vent here and to read of others whose story, while not the same has many similarities. I have ordered a suppliment that a few people seem to have had success with (to raise TSH) but it won't arrive till next week and I will see what happens with my next bloods on Sunday. I have not been referred to an endocrinologist and have had no antibodies or scans done yet, going to ask again for the antibodies for this Sundays test, I also don't appear to have a goitre or lumps on my thyroid. My thyroid function was checked in 2012 due to a similar scenario and my TSH was 0.6 and T4 14.7 I have to wonder if I have been here before and just got over it as it remained subclinical. Anyway I am convinced I will survive this, something I couldn't say two weeks ago. Thanks for the opportunity to post here, it really helps (even though I feel like I have written war and peace ..... twice lol sorry for that my mind is not very organised just now). Take care everyone and good luck Jeni Just an update with TFT blood work results ... Free T4 14.5 (range 9 - 19) TSH has tripled to be 0.19 (range 0.4 - 4) antibodies are not back yet but my GP thinks they will be normal. In a week I can start reducing my carbimazole with the hope that I may be able to stop taking it ..... YAY! Seems like my body is righting itself, but its really too early to say. I will post when my antibody results are back.\n",
      "Hi guys, i am new here but desperate for unput. For 7 months my life has gone upside down. I've been anxious, fearful, depressed, freezing cold(basal temperatures always under 97.0), hair loss, dandruff, joint aches, swelling, severe fatigue, cant lose 1 pound of baby weight(baby born jan 2016), brain fog, forgetful and the list goes on and on.

      "Hi all, I went to the doctor as I could feel lumps on my neck which I believed to be on my thyroid. I had a blood test with a TSH level of 2.96 and they found goiter and 6 nodules (the biggest was 5cm x 2cm). I recently started noticing some symptoms which I have found to be linked with hypothyroidism, such as constipation (which I never have before), cold sensitivity, fatigue, and the biggest one is weight gain. I have recently started trying to lose weight (which is normally very easy for me to do at the start) and have put on over 2kg in one week! That is unheard of for me. Is it possible I do have hypothyroidism or the nodules are affecting me in some way? My doctor thinks nothing of it and says TSH is normal. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Andrea\n",

      "So, I've never had an abnormal thyroid test in my life but the only thyroid test that I haven't had done is RT3. I was always told by every doctor I've ever had including an Endo, that RT3 is only used in very rare circumstances and I didn't need it. My symptoms include consistent, brutally stubborn body fat, cold intolerance, brain fog, non-existent libido and fatigue. All of these symptoms came about at 22 years old. I am now 31. for reference, here are my last blood tests: Results Range TSH - 1.39 0.4-4.5 mIU/L T4 FREE- 1.4 0.8-1.8 NG/DL FSH- 3.4 1.6-8 MIU/ML T3 TOTAL -126 76-181 NG/DL From these tests and others like Testosterone, estrogen, ect, I seem to be in perfect metabolic condition but I feel like garbage. I've been an athlete my entire life and I eat very, very clean. Could Reverse T3 be the missing link? Is Wilson's syndrome a legit condition? Any input is appreciated!\n",

      "Hi All I'm not sure where to post anymore as I'm not sure what's going on with me. In brief: 2006 diagnosed with hypothyroidism with multiple nodules. Put on armour thyroid until 2015 when my readings turned hyper. My T's were always normal but TSH never rose, even after a year off armour. Fast forward: During 2016 I started feeling very weak and had \"almost\" fainting spells. Felt just like low blood sugar and a glass of orange juice helped. Schedule appt with PCP who diagnosed me as hyperthyroid. TSH 0.004, almost non existent. Normal T's. Tested my antibodies and I had TSI and TPO so he wasn't sure if I had graves or if it was my nodules turning overactive. So I had a radioactive iodine uptake scan. The result was normal function of the thyroid other than one nodule - 3cm - on right lobe which absorbed most of the iodine. Diagnosis was \"hot nodule\". By then my T3 was high normal and T4 was a few points over normal. Started on 10 mg of Methimazole 10mg on Jan 11th of this year. Been having monthly blood tests and TSH came up to 0.015, which is still too low and is hyper, but my T 3 was perfect mid range last test with T4 being just at the top range. So I remained on Methimazole. Lately my hair is becoming so limp and my fingernails and even toe nails are so dry and lined. I never had this before the med. I am not due for another blood test for a week. Meantime, I'm feeling hypo: lethargic, freezing cold, a bit achy and headachy. I have brain fog and I can't find my words!! It's scaring the heck out of me. I get occular migraines and last Feb 2016, I had a terrible bout of Labrynthitis (ear virus causing severe vertigo then constant dizziness ebbing to unsteadiness) This lasted 3 months. My pcp feels it caused a thyrotoxic state and that's where the antibodies came from. But at the tail end of that virus, I had an occular migraine with aura that also affected my speech. I was talking jibberish. Rushed to the ER thinking it was a stroke but after tests it turned out to be just another type of migraine. I feel awful. It's very hard to find anyone with overactive thyroid nodules to compare symptoms and info with. I read hypo can cause speech problems where you can't think of the words you want to say. That migraine/speech thing threw me for a loop, so now I'm always on guard and hoping it's low blood sugar or thyroid causing my \"slow brain\" and not something else affecting it. I feel low blood sugar all the time. Most of the time eating helps but sometimes, like now, I still feel cold, weak, scared, and unsure of what's even wrong with me now. Hyper or Hypo from Methimazole? Anyone ever have these issues, especially is there anyone here with nodules that have gone \"hot\" and active and caused hyperthyroidism? Not sure if I mentioned, but I'm forgetful and just can't think at times and it's frightening. I worry I'm on the verge of a stroke. I can't get another blood test for another week. Meantime, I would like to know if anyone else has had any problems like this. Thank you Jaye\n",

      "Hello! I'm new to this forum. I'm Shellzie and was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I'd been suffering from many symptoms that are normal... worst of all was exhaustion. Making it through a full day of work was a victory and spent most of my weekends sleeping. I was diagnosed based on a level of 11. I have a few symptoms that are backwards though. I'm not cold sensitive, generally hot. Since starting synthroid, I'm sweating and hot flashing again. Major symptoms are fatigue, aching body, hair loss, brain fog, inability to lose weight & did I say fatigue? I was so thrilled when I finally had a diagnosis that made sense and started on synthroid. I felt SO good after starting meds. Energy levels were much better and my brain fog was lifting. Enter today... I'm not tired but boy am I irritable! Grumpy! Angry! I feel like all of my nerves are standing at attention and I'd love to crawl out of my skin. Is this normal?? I know it will take time to get stable and on the right dosage but this feels nuts!!

      "Back in November, I went to a women's health doctor because I was, well, having some women's health issues, mainly hormone problems. She ran some blood work along with a thyroid check, and I received these numbers: T4 TOTAL: 15.50 (5.53-11.0ug/dL) 227.8 (71.1-141.6nmol/L) T3 TOTAL: 1.95 (.97-1.7ng/mL) 4.08 (1.49-2.60nmol/L) TSH: 9.10 (.465-4.68mUI/L) FREE T3: 3.59 (2.71-6.16pg/mL) 29.41 (4.17-9.46pmol/L) FREE T4: 1.12 (.64-1.79ng/dL) 78.30 (8.27-23.1pmol/L) IODINE PROTEIN: 10.85 (4-8mUI/L) (There are more but I think these are the most imporatant) She told me there was a problem, said I had hyperthyrodism and put me on 2.5 mg of Tapazol. Two months after this, I do another round of blood work and all of my numbers are in the normal range but she doesn't believe the numbers, says I couldn't have reach normal levels in such a short period of time. She cut my dose of Tapazol to 1.75mg. Two months after this, I do yet another round of blood work. I got my results back by email and see the doctor this Thursday. Here is what I find: (all using the same variable above) T4 TOTAL: 8.5 T3 TOTAL: 1.12 TSH: 6.26 IODINE PROTEIN: 5.23 What is going on? So many people were shocked, actually shocked when I told them I had hyperthyroid because I have more symptoms of hypo. First off, I am overweight and have a hard time loosing it, but I do associate myself with some characteristics of hyper. Could have I both or could I have one of the autoimmue thyroid diseases?\n",

      "Hi everyone: Reading the message boards not only this, i´m impressed with medical negligence with thyroid issues, after alll my case hasn`t been so 'hard'.............nearly seven years(may be more) i became with carpal tunel syndrom,low sex drive(i´m 37 years old male, 30 years then), erection problems, but urologist and endochrinologist said that all was in my head and sent me two times to psychiatrist, since then TSH has waving between 4 and 6(nearly seven, now at 4,5, on six i felt like if i had 10000 years old) they told me \"you are fine, you are in the range, you have subclinical hypo, dont worry\" , no ft3 or ft4, testosterone enantate shuts didn´t tickle me, endo told me that could be neurologic, for me it´s very hard gain a muscle inch. Since two years ago i became insomniac(wake up at 3:30 or 4)to never return to bed, constant head ache, my hair began to fall, sex drive falls more, i became to feel tired and sleepy all the time, lost apetite and my weight went lower, talking with a friend that does have thyroid issues told me that i should go to a private endochrinologist.........the result 7 years(or more) believing that i was crazy of with some kind of neurological damage and finally was hypothyroidism bad diagnosed , and now have half eyebrows, very dry skin with and all the other symptoms that could have been avoided SEVEN YEARS AGO...... Anyway i wanna ask, i´m taking levo(Eutirox) 50mcg on daily basis, first to weeks was marvelous, i realized that i´ve been fu***** used to be tired, much, much energy, but at somepoint in the third week i became to a zombie very irritable state and i would know if this state will pass soon?, i just wanna feel all these energy again, doctor would up the dose?what happens from now on?eyebrows will grow again?\n",
      "When I was younger (around age 13) I had Grave's Disease treated with radioactive iodine treatment twice. My thyroid has never been regulated more than 6 months since then. It is always high or low. I take my medication at the same time each day, usually 3 hours or more after my last meal (I found I took it at the same time and not as close to a meal if I took at night). I make sure to take it with just water. I even switched to the atrociously expensive Tirosint to try and regulate it better. No luck. Is everyone this way? about 6 months ago my doctor decreased the dose again and at the next appointment TSH was even lower, then he lowered the dose again and my last blood test showed the TSH even lower that the previous. I have had the opposite happen before too... where they will raise the dosage and TSH will go way up or sometimes way way down so that they have to drop me back to the previous dose again. Anyone dealt with this? Anyone have a good solution? I have been dealing with lots of weird symptoms that all the docs just say are psychocomatic (diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fast HR, high and low BP, dizziness)... could it be my thyroid? Edit: sorry I am now 28... so long after ablation.\n",
      "Hi Has anyone experienced tacycardia Waking up in am. It has been going on for months. TSH 2.4 Ft3 2.3 ft4 1.4 I am having hypoglycemia too. Check blood sugar fine, but have low at 0300 every night eat and drink Gatorade. HGB A1c 5.4 normal She is rechecking cortisol but won't do saliva. I have to take 1/4 5mg propanolol. I've been having tacycardia with synthroid but that seems to level heart rate. I am on 125mcg hoping to up . I did sleep study waiting for results bc I have apnea since Hypo. Not over weight. Can't take t3 swung Hyper on low dose in two weeks .When synthroid wears off left with shortness of breath air hunger. Worse in evening. Cardio work up fine. Said it's all thyroid. Thanks\n",
      "So here's my story.. I've been dealing with hypothyroidism for about 8 yrs now and my regular doctor has been treating me but has now decided to refer me to an endo. I do have 2 small nodules but they are not growing. I'm currently on Synthroid 112 and Cytomel 25 and haven't had a dosage change in about a year. My labs in August weren't too bad but levels were a little low but tsh was really low but I was still having minimal hypo symptoms but no dosage change. I just had labs run at the end of February and all my levels are really low, outside of the range even and my tsh is still low so now my doctor is worried about hyper but I have a lot of hypo symptoms and barely functioning to be able to work every day. I was under the impression that treating with t4 & t3 might suppress tsh. These are my February labs. TSH = 0.058 (0.450 - 4.500) Free T4 = 0.72 (0.82 - 1.77) Free T3 = 1.5 (2.0 - 4.4) T4 = 5.0 (4.5 - 12.0) T3 = 61 (71 - 180) T3 Uptake = 25 (24-39) Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab = 12 (0-34) Anyone ever deal with this where all the levels appear to be bottomed out, many hypo symptoms and all they look at is the tsh and not the individual levels? I'm looking for another regular doctor to see because I have had issues with mine on several other things but waiting for the endo appt to be scheduled. I've not had much luck with the 2 that are around where I live so I'm not too anxious to see them again. Thanks for any help or advice you may have!\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "Hi, I have been feeling crappy since summer 2016, symptoms including: * cold even in warmer weather * extreme fatigue (sleeping 12 hours not enough) * no energy to do much * bad moods/verging on depression * gained weight and difficulty losing etc. etc. over growing concerns, I got my blood tested and had a result of 6.1 for TSH and told by the doctor that although it's borderline, they do not begin treatment until it hits 10. Having done some research, I found this quite concerning, not to mention the undeniable symptoms, so I got private more thorough tests done on my thyroid and received the following results: THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE * 4.54 mIU/L 0.27 ‐ 4.2 FREE THYROXINE * 11.9 pmol/l 12.0 ‐ 22.0 TOTAL THYROXINE(T4) 72 nmol/L 59 ‐ 154 FREE T3 4.9 pmol/L 3.1 ‐ 6.8 Thyroglobulin Antibody 15.2 IU/mL 0‐115 Method used for Anti‐Tg: Roche Modular Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies 9.4 IU/mL 0 ‐ 34 Method used for Anti‐TPO: Roche Modular From research I have found that my results are far from normal, but I am not sure what to do next. I have been looking at possibly buying Levothyroxine at 50mcg before dishing out more money to see what more doctors can tell me, but is this recommended? Many thanks for any input!\n",
      "Hi all, I went to the dr today because of frequent heart palpitations and she wanted to test my thyroid. I had TSH and t4 tested. The levels were TSH: 1.9 Free T4: 14 They were both \"in range\" but to my understanding low tsh and high t4 could be hyperthyroid. Is it possible to still be hyperthyroid even though both numbers are still \"in range\"?\n",
      "I had been taking 50 mc of Synthroid for about 6 years. Had annual visit at doctor, numbers were in range but had gone up a little and he decided to raise dose to 88. Also I felt fine on my original dose. I thought that seemed like a lot but said ok. He said if it seems too high, jitters, anxiety, etc to let him know. In a few weeks I had to call and ask him to lower to 75. I took that for a few months and the anxiety, jitters, muscle aches, hearing heartbeat in my ear, high heart rate, etc. began to be overwhelming. As I read online it seemed to be all the symptoms of being medicated to hyperthyroid. Went back to doctor, stopped all medicine for 10 days to get out of system and am now back on 50 again and feel well. I am telling all of this to say that if you feel off from a dose change, or no dose change when you don't feel well listen to your body and talk to doctor. I don't know why he raised my dose that much, or at all but he does listen to me and changed it back. You have to advocate for how you are feeling.\n",
      "Hello - I am so frustrated with doctors right now and I'm so glad that I discovered this site in the hopes that someone can assist me with advice. I was diagnosed hypoT about 7 years ago and put on Armour 90 mg. I tolerated it well and felt fairly good but had terrible insomnia and a fast heart rate. I finally went to an Endo a few months ago to check things out. My labs were as follows: T4 Free - 0.91 (0.82-1.77) T3 Total - 158 ng (71-180) (Dr. didn't order a T3 Free test) TSH 0.285 (0.450-4.50) Thyroid Peroxidase AB - 11 IU (0.34) In reading some of the posts I now know that being on Armour can cause the T4 Free to be low and maybe I wasn't actually in the hyper range. Regardless, my Endo wanted me off Armour and put me on Tirosint 125 because it's pure and I'm lactose and gluten intolerant. After 5 weeks I started feeling terrible. No energy (yes, I was definitely sleeping at night!) and a very down feeling - almost apathetic. Constipation and every other symptom that goes with Hypo. I could barely form a sentence due to brain fog. My doctor said to go ahead and get tests done again. Those results were: T4 Free - 1.64 (0.82-1.77) T3 Total - 92 (71-180) T3 Free - 2.3 (2.0-4.4) TSH 0.108 (0.450 - 4.50) My Endo said I was now hyper and wanted to lower Tirosint to 112 and get labs done in another 6 wks. I said there was no way I could keep feeling this way and that I wanted to go back on Armour. She doesn't want me to and suggested I try Cytomel 5 mcg one time per day (along with Tirosint 112) and if that works I could go to twice a day in 2 weeks. I took the Cytomel for 3 days and couldn't take the nausea. I'm beginning to think that I'm one of the people who might do better on NDT. I've actually started taking the Armour again and once I let my Endo know I'm sure I will have to go back to my primary doctor for future prescriptions. Do any of you think my original labs were that bad? I was in the upper level for my T3 and I felt better then. It would be nice to not have the rapid heart beat and sleep better but at least I felt good while on Armour. I'm so confused as to what medicine/strength to be on. One other issue that I think is connected is that I'm trying to get hormones regulated with hormone pellets and I've had a lot of breakthrough bleeding these past few months. I now think it is definitely connected to my thyroid meds not being right. Any advice on the strength and best medicine would be greatly appreciated. I'm losing faith in my doctors .\n",
      "I am a 48 year old female runner who has been on Synthroid (started at 75 mcg; currently at 137 mcg) for 11 years. My thyroid labs have been good, and I have been feeling okay as far as my hypo symptoms go. However, I fell while running last July, and I was recently diagnosed with a stress fracture in my hip (ilium). The doctors say it is an unusual place for the bone to break and suspect osteoporosis. I have a bone scan scheduled for Mon. but am nervous. My doctor said I probably would be on Synthroid for life, but do patients get weaned off it if they develop this adverse reaction (bone loss), if it is likely a result of the Synthroid? Has anyone been treated for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism? Thanks!\n",
      "Hello everyone. Just a little about me. I am a 44yo male that's had a life long issue with anxiety/panic attacks. So much so that I am on social security disability partially because of it. Things to do with health, especially, really freak me out. A couple of years ago I had back surgery for a herniated disc. Then about 8 months or so ago I started getting pain in the right side of my neck. The doc prescribed physical therapy thinking it was disc related. After a couple of sessions the therapist recommenced I stop PT because it was painful when they would give me a neck massage especially in the front right part of my neck and he also said he could feel my pulse way more easily on that side compared to the left which didn't seem right to him. I went back and told all this to my family doctor and he gave me an exam and felt my neck and said he couldn't feel anything wrong. He basically sent me home thinking it was muscle strain with possible mild arthritis in the neck. The pain seemed to get better for a while, but then started to come back over the past couple of months. This pas week I had a doctor visit for a regular checkup and mentioned to him that I was still having neck pain. He ordered a CT scan which came back as enlarged thyroid. He then ordered a ultrasound and it showed I had 2 solid nodules on my thyroid. I don't know the full dimensions, but they said the nodule on the left is 4cm and the one on the right is 3cm. They said the next step is fine needle biopsy. The second I heard biopsy I was scarred stiff. I went straight to google looking stuff up and got more confused and even more frightened. I've read that being a male makes the likelihood of cancer higher, the size of the nodule being solid and over 2cm increases the risk even further. My symptoms: pain in the right side of neck, pain in my right side near lower rib, irritability, cant take cold weather, shortness of breath like my stomach is really full and I feel tried a lot. I don't have trouble swallowing, I'm not hoarse, and don't have a cough or or anything. Another thing that worries me is I had high calcium in blood tests for the past couple years Levels in the 10.2-10.5 range. Had my parathyroid checked and came back normal. All this adds up to the fear that I might have thyroid cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes, lungs, and bones especially since I've had problems with the elevated calcium. I know I should try to stop worrying until I get the results from the biopsy, but I cant help it.. I am worried sick. Does it sound like my nodules are more likely to be cancer? thanks all\n",
      "About a month ago, I woke up without a voice and a croupy cough. I have choking sensations & jaw/chin pain. I had chest xray, ultrasound of thyroid & soft tissue. The soft tissue had enlarged nodes. The thyroid ultrasound was normal. The chest xray showed pleural effusion. After antibiotics, I had a cervical & chest CT which were both normal. I still feel choking sensations in the thyroid area, as well as jaw/chin pain. I also have fluid pockets on my upper cheek, and burning sensations on various parts of my body. Could this possibly be subacute thyroiditis? My ENT says it's allergies. I don't believe that is the problem. Help!!!\n",

      "I just came from endo visit, he seemed please to see the increase in FT4 .. said it takes a while to really feel the changes. He seemed hesitant to increase but offered an option to increase from 100 to 112.5mcg T4 (gave me synthroid samples, prior i was on levo 100) and decrease to 5 T3 from 10 down to 5. I follow up in May he isn't ordering labs for may so i guess he will go by how i \"feel\" not sure, new dr only 2nd visit. I mentioned aiming for ft4 of 1.3 and Ft3 mid`range with the med fasted labs and he said everyone is really different and is hard to go set a specific lab goal. what are your thoughts on this? I am a bit nervous to drop the T3 down to 5.. also i noticed my morning drink.. has a small bit of calcium about 13.75mg of calicum, is that enough to interfere with the thyroid absorption? my labs were as follows 3 hours post taking thyroid meds as he instructed FT4 1 (.82-1.77) ft3 3.6 (2-4.4) here are labs in which i hadn't taken meds that day ft4 . .92(.82-1.77) FT3 2.4 ( 2- 4.4) I am still on the low end of the ranges not sure why he wants me to stop the T3 and why he was hesitant to increase the T4 , and of course when i am setting in the appointment i am \"dumbfounded\" and can never think to ask these questions. maybe since we are increasing the T4 he is suspecting my FT3 will go up..that is if i can convert it. not sure how to proceed, if i should call him or jst make another appointment to ask questions, or just keep my T3 dosing the same? he also wants me to drop my HC dose from 25 down to 20. .lots of changes at one time. looking forward to hearing your thoughts! thank you!\n",
      "Hi Everyone! I am new here and have a question. I had complete thyroidectomy in 2012 due to Follicular Carcinoma and Papillary thyroid carcinoma. Last March 2016 my medication dosage was lowered, since that time my nails are very brittle and split and I have gained 20 pounds. I was taking Synthroid 175mcg, the Endo reduced me to 150mcg, I gained 10 pounds in about 6 months. Then he raised it up to 168mcg and I am still gaining. Do I need to ask my Endo to raise me back up to 175mcg a day again. Are these symptoms of being hypo? Thanks, Trinity p.s. I haven't seen my Endo in almost a year, the last two appointments he was out of office on my appointment day and I kept getting rescheduled. My next appointment is for the end of March.\n",
      "After a CT scan for an unrelated issue showed an enlarged thyroid, I had an ultrasound today. Results came back quicker than expected, I haven't seen the actual report, but the Dr called to tell me they found a module, that was 4.4 cm. I've been diagnosed as hypothyroid for over 3 years (though should have been tested a decade or more earlier had I known what I know now). I'm waiting for an appointment for a FNA biopsy, and quite frankly, I'm terrified.\n",
      "I had a FNA of 4 nodules on my thyroid. Of 4 nodules, one was deemed \"scant bland follicular thyroid epithelium with a predominant micro-acinar pattern, cannot exclude a follicular neoplasm\". Two others were deemed \"Atypical follicular cells of undertermined significance\". All 3 were on right lobe. A fourth was on left lobe and was classified as a benign thyroid nodule with a cystic compenent. In researching my doctor's recommendation for sugery I came upon this test developed for \"atypical\" findings. Called Afirma made by Veracyte. Was wondering if anyone has had this test done and what was outcome?\n",

I took a second Doctor's opinion. He said it was just clotted blood and was able to pull it by a syringe. I received the lab tests where T3 was somewhat high, but normal T4 and TSH level. Free T3= 7.17 Pmol/L or 4.7 Pg/ml (normal range 2.3-4.2 pg/ml) Free T4=17.87 pmol/l or 1.39 ng/dl (normal range 0.8-1.8 ng/dl) TSH= 3.65uiU/ml or 3.65 mIU/L (normal range 0.3-3.04) High T3 and High TSH... what is that? hypo or hyper?

      "Hi everyone! How long can the hypo phase of subacute thyroiditis (viral) go on for? Can it last for over a year? Is there hope? I really don't want to have to resort to a lifetime of medication. but it looks like I may have to. I went through a bad case of subacute thyroiditis in October 2014. The hyper phase was pretty severe and went on and on for several months and I'm pretty sure I had at least once recurrence. For 2015 I was clinically hypo briefly and thereafter through 2016, my labs were in range. Hypo side of the range, but in range. I thought I was gonna make a recovery. But here we are in early 2017, and my labs are showing that I'm going hypo again; my labs are out of range now.

      "So, I had an ultrasound of my thyroid last week and was told that I have a nodule. I was told that we would just monitor it, but I am not sure that I feel comfortable with that... Here is a bit of history: I saw a rheumatologist for the first time about a year ago, after I was found to gastroparesis and a positive ANA (1:160 homogenous pattern). After a few visits and lots of blood work (everything else was negative), the rheumy dx UCTD. I tried Plaquenil, but it was too harsh for my stomach, so I don't currently take meds for that. I had melanoma removed from my arm with wide excision and lymph node testing 3 years ago. A year ago, around the same time I was referred to a rheumy, I had an ultrasound of my thyroid because I could feel a small lump or enlargement. The ultrasound was found to be normal/negative. I saw my rheumy at the end of December and while feeling my lymph nodes, she thought she felt the enlargement too and sent me to my primary care to be referred for an ultrasound. This time, a 5mm hypoechoic nodule was found. Here are results: EXAMS: REASON FOR EXAM: CPT CODES: 200596189 US SOFT TISSUE HEAD/NEC THYROID NODULE 76536 INDICATION: THYROID NODULE COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and color ultrasound images obtained of the thyroid. FINDINGS: Right Lobe: 45 x 18 x 15 mm. Left Lobe: 38 x 16 x 13 mm. 5 mm hypoechoic nodule right lobe of thyroid IMPRESSION: 1. Small hypoechoic nodule right lobe of the thyroid. This could be cystic but there is some apparent internal echoes identified which could be artifactual in nature or secondary to a complex component. Follow-up ultrasound could be obtained in a year to ensure no growth My TSH is 1.95 mIU/ML, Free T4 is .91 ng/dl What makes me nervous is A. that I have had melanoma before so the odds of me getting another cancer are increased and B. after doing some research online, it sounds like most thyroid cancers are hypoechoic and solid. Anyone experienced with this?? The primary care doc just said we will do another ultrasound in a year, but if this is cancer, I don't know that I want it sitting in my neck for a year.\n",
      "I was recently diagnosed with hyper thyroid.I believe this was on going for some time and ignored by our primary care physician.

Does anyone have a suggestion for a Dr. In north Denver?\n",

      "Hello - I am new to the group and have a few questions. First, let me give you my history (from what I can remember.) I am currently 29. When I was 16 I began to lose weight uncontrollably. I was at the time getting help for an eating disorder, but I was eating healthy and on the road to recovery. In fact, I was eating A LOT and still losing. During this time I was preparing for college applications, SATs and the every day stresses of high school. I went to a pediatrician who specialized in endocrinology. He did bloodwork and determined I had hyper thyroidism. Along with putting me on medicine for this, he also put me on medicine for my heart which was beating too fast. Despite have all the typical symptoms (mainly heart palpitations and weight loss, losing hair, etc) I also found out I had 4 nodules on my thyroid during an ultrasound (if that matters...) I remember him telling me I didn't have the enzyme that suggested having the actual thyroid disease, just the hormone levels were off. He almost made it seem like it was a temporary problem brought on by stress. Fast forward a few years later, I was at the end of my treatment and my doctor was arrested for molesting his patients (yikes!) I went away to college and never was treated for thyroid issues again. Now I'm 29, overweight (5 ft 3 and 180lbs.) I eat fairly healthy, walk regularly, and can't seem to drop weight. My husband and I want children so as I start to prepare myself for this, I'd like to lose weight along with making sure my thyroid is OK. I did read women who have thyroid issues during pregnancy can have children with potential risk of developing mental disabilities. This is obviously a concern of mine, along with being able to conceive and be healthy not only for myself, but for the baby. I recently had blood work done but I've heard from several people that often thyroid issues don't appear in blood work. Is there another route to go? I feel as if I have many of the symptoms to suggest a low active thyroid.\n",
      "I have been having odd symptoms. They are listed below. Am I over medicated. This test was 3 weeks ago. My levels have never been this high. Am I possibly overmedicated on Synthroid even though I'm barely in the \"normal\" range?

      "I am a 32 yr old female who has had a rough two and a half years, but before that I had been pretty okay except always had female problems. In November 2014, I was diagnosed with fibro (had hysterectomy, kept ovaries). Since then, it's been carpal tunnel and arthritis (surgery both hands), ulcers, IBS, Diaphragmatic hernia, Gastro-esophageal reflux disease with esophagitis, then TMJ (two jaw surgeries), livedo vasculitis, kidney stones, reoccurring ovarian cysts, reoccurring bladder infections with hematura, fibrocystic breasts, then sjrogrens that caused me to get a tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy surgery as they thought it might help. It didn't. That is six surgeries and countless procedures since November 2014, and symptoms that won't stop. Recently, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis with a bone scan. I'm usually anemic. Besides normal RA symptoms, I feel I have symptoms of both hypo and hyper, although more hypo besides the fact I have lost weight, (like 30 pounds without trying) not gained it, over the last two years. I'm about 113 pounds at 5'4, but a year or so ago, I was 150. I recently looked back at my thyroid levels from the last two years, and I wanted someone's opinion. I go for more testing soon as when I showed my doctor, he agreed something may be going on but wouldn't say what. I'll go for an updated full thyroid profile that includes antibodies and cortisol testing soon. Regardless, these are the numbers I have now. They come from different labs over the dates, so the ranges are different on some of them. I thought it wasn't at all normal for TSH and Free T4 to be low at the same time. Any thoughts appreciated. I have never been on medication of any kind for thyroid. Thank you.

      "My mom is getting her thyroid removed (full thyroidectomy) next tuesday. She was taking anti-thyroid medicine to get her hormone levels under control but in the process she became hypo. Her endo told her the anesthesiologist probably wouldn't give the go ahead to have the surgery until the TSH was lower and T4 higher. In the pre-op consultation the anesthesiologist told her that it didn't matter that she was hypo and she could have the surgery. Her TSH was at 64, so pretty high. I am now really confused if she should go ahead or not. Is it dangerous to undergo a thyroidectomy in a hypo state?\n",

      "Hi All, Little history. Jan 10th of this year I was admitted to Hospital for high heart rate 150/180 BPM. I had been very ill with a cold for a week up to that point. Turns out I had phenomena. I was observed to be in persistent afib and omitted to the hospital. They discovered I had hyperthyroidism Graves thru blood work. they attempted to convert my afib 3 times with drugs in the hospital. It didn't work. I was started on Metoprolol 100mg x2 a day and Methimazole 10mg 2x a day. I only took the beta blocker for two weeks then was switched to Diltazem 120mg 1x a day. The beta blocker gave me terrible insomnia. I had a follow up with the endo on the 26th of Jan. She up'ed the Methimazole to 10mg 3x a day. she said my labs show I was still slightly hyper active. But it was way down from they first test. My issue is over the last two weeks. I've lost nearly all my body hair and a large potion for it on my head. I assume i was hyper for the better part of last year and didn't have this problem. I had shaky hands weak arms and legs and occasional afib episodes. The doctors seem uncaring about the hair loss. As you can imagine its top on my list. So what is the more lily culprit? the blood pressure med, the anti thyriod med, or could I be converting to hypo? The Endo wont retest for 3 more weeks. From my end that;s a long time to wait.\n",
      "hi, I have grave's disease. I need help with my dose of methimazole. I think my endocrinologist is not very good and I don't know what to do. I am on 2.5 mg methimazole since November last year. I feel really really cold all the time lately and now I started to have no energy and feel sleepy a lot during the day. I know these are signs of hypothyroidism. I called my endocrinologist and told him my symptoms but he does not want to change my dosage because my latest results are in the range see below. These are my latest results for end of January 2017: FT3 2.8 range 2.3- 4.2 TSH 2.6 range 0.33 - 4.7 FT4 1.0 range 0.89-1.76 12/31/2016 FT3 2.9 range 2.3- 4.2 TSH 1.46 range 0.33 - 4.7 FT4 0.92 range 0.89-1.76 11/04/2016 -- this is when my hyperthyroidism was again detected FT3 2.6 range 2.0- 3.6 TSH 0.08 range 0.38 - 4.31 FT4 1.21 range 0.72-1.90 I was diagnosed with graves march 2016. I went on a serious detox alkaline diet fruits and vegetables only with detox herbs for 5 months. The doc put me on 30 mg methimazole daily and then they took me off methimazole in June last year I think. My levels were dropping fast and they kept descreasig my meds. In august my blood tests came perfect. then in beginning of November last year they found slight hyperthyroidism and put me on 2.5 mg methimazole. In the last 2, 3 weeks I started to feel really really cold. I now feel so so cold all the time. I am freezing. I am still doing detox + herbs. I also started to feel sleepy. My endo does not want to change my dose. What do you advise? Thank you.\n",
      "I've been dealing with over 100 symptoms which seem to be relatable to a thyroid problem, but apparently, I'm normal. I'm so sad right now because I'm so exhausted I have very little of my old life left. The doctors want to diagnose me with M.E. but I really am not convinced. My most recent results were T4 14.4 range 12-22 T3 4.2 range 3.1-6.8 TSH 2.2 range 0.27-22 I had the antibodies test which was very low but I can't find the numbers. The T4 is on the lower end of normal, could that on its own cause an issue? I've been told I need to let it go and accept I have M.E, but when I saw the specialist, even she didn't agree fully that I had it. I'm so desperate right now and I really don't know what to do. I even have the missing eyebrows 😢I was referred 3 times to an endocrinologist but he kept cancelling the appointments and refused to see me, despite one of my doctors asking. He felt that as my bloods were normal, there was no need. Please advise if you can, is there anything I can do or try? I'm really getting to the end of my tether\n",
      "I am new to all of this...but for years I have been having thyroid symptoms. I have begged my doctor to run the gamut of thyroid tests. She claimed she did and everything was always \"normal\". My symptoms seem to get progressively worse over the past 3 years or so. Today I signed up for my insurance companys' app to track my appointments and test results and such. Turns out she never ran all the tests she claimed. Only a TSH in 2015 and a TSH and Free T4 last year. These were the numbers: 2015: TSH/Thy.Stim.Horm 1.25 µIU/mL 2016: TSH/Thy.Stim.Horm 0.84 mIU/L FREE T4 0.9 NG/DL Just looking at the 'normal' ranges from my lab, it seems like I am on the very low end of normal. Considering I have multiple symptoms would medication be warranted? I have since found a new doctor and happen to have an appointment tomorrow. I don't know much about thyroid other than reading online, but everything I have read says that a normal range may not mean normal?! Thanks! Lauren\n",
      "Hello All, I am a 24 year old male new to the forum and desperately seeking advice. For the previous four months i have been experiencing a lot of the symptoms of Hypothyroidism. I lack any appetite at all (I still have the ability to eat however i just dont feel hungry), cold hands and feet, thinning hair ( used to have very thick hair however i can now see my scalp and i find 3-4 pieces of hair in each hand after putting gel in it) i did have acid reflux however my doctor proscribed me 20 mg omeprazole. I sometimes have night sweats, and i feel exhausted after eating typically. I have also noticed that there is a movable lump in my throat to the left of my Adams apple. It is soft and rubbery in texture, my doctor does not seem to think it is anything to worry about. I have had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, upper abdominal ultrasound, CBC, and thyroid tests and all have come back normal. Below are my thyroid tests, are these indicative of any possible thyroid disorder?

I'm waiting on the results of the antibodies test because that takes a bit longer, but my T3 and T4 were good. Has anyone gone through something similar? I'm not sure what to think at this point; what does the fluctuation mean?\n",

I'm concerned because I'm fatigued no matter how much rest I get, have spastic skips in my heartbeat, a little muscle weakness (left leg), and get cold easily. My doctor insists that I'm within normal range. Should I have concerns about my levels? Or should I be concerned about something else?\n",

Don't these go hand in hand? Would I be feeling better anyway if my TSH was above 1? should I ask doc about going on thyroid medication anyway to help gain weight and stop these tremors?

      "Hi community, I am the mother of a 15 year old diagnosed in September with Hashimoto. Her numbers: 9/2016 Cortisol 28.5 TSH 4.56 ACTH Plasma 11 T4 free 1.2 thyroid peroxidase >900 thyroglobulin 67 iga quantitative serum 161, tissue transglutiminase ab, Riga <4 They basically called me and said she needs levothyroxine (actually the doctor didn't even call, I got a call from the pharmacy telling me to come pick up the prescription. For this I pay $1200 a month in health insurance.) We put her on the levo but symptoms didn't really improve at all although her numbers went down (TSH) 11/2016 Cortisol 12.2 TSH 2.4 I read that many people do better on Synthroid and fought with the doctor to make the switch but honestly she's not better. Prior to diagnoses we had 2 years of chronic headache and lethargy. We've had every body system in this kid looked at (not a Rheumatologist yet) Prior to her diagnosis she seemed to have a period of escalation that included numbness, dizziness, brain fog, just being generally out of it, not feeling good, tripping over things, frankly she was a mess. We discovered her vitamin D was very low and started supplementing with 5000 mg a day. Those symptoms disappeared but the headaches and fatigue have remained. Her acne is pretty bad which I understand can be thyroid related. I am trying to help her but I feel like a crackpot - reading and reading and trying all these things -supplements, diets...hoping something will help. I should add that she occasionally gets 'inner tremors' her arms 'feel shaky or vibrate inside' but you can't see anything on the outside. My doctor is not helpful. I asked to have her antibody numbers retested in November because we had been working with some holistic diet changes. She ignored that completely and did not order the labs. I asked for a full thyroid panel and she ordered something that basically tests the full panel ONLY if the TSH is above normal. There aren't a lot of pediatric thyroid doctors in my area to choose from. Should I seek an adult doctor? Sigh. Feeling lost - there are few things harder than feeling like you can't help your kid feel better. The headaches and the fatigue and the acne are literally depressing her. Where do I go from here?\n",
      "Hi all, I am new to this forum and new to learning about thyroid disorders so please forgive my ignorance. I could use some advice. For as long as I can remember I have struggled with being tired and having no energy. Years ago, I was told by a friend that it might be my thyroid. I looked up hypothyroidism and I seemed to have a good majority of the symptoms. When I spoke to my Dr in the past about it, he always replied that my TSH was normal so my thyroid was fine. A weird thing happened a few weeks ago that forced my Dr to order more comprehensive thyroid tests. I began having heart palpitations and a high heart rate without any exertion. I felt jittery like I had 20 cups of coffee although I had none. It lasted all day and progressively got worse. Went to the ER where I was told I had erratic tachycardia with PVCs. My blood pressure was also quite high for me 133/99 (it's usually low). They said there was nothing life threatening and sent me home to followup with my Dr. for a comprehensive thyroid panel and possible cardiology referal. They said my symptoms were indicative of possible hyperthyroidism despite my lifelong symptoms more consistent with hypothyroidism. The hyper symptoms lasted about 4 days until they subsided. My labs: TSH 1.444. Range 0.450-5.100 TSH. from a month prior was .99. Range .35-4.94 Free T3. 3.56. Range 2.77-5.27 Free T4. 0.9. Range 0.7-1.5 Thyroglobulin Auto antibody <.9. Range 0-4 Thyroid Peroxidase Auto Ab 0.4. Range 0-9 When I asked if I should see an endocrinologist for evaluation, my Dr. said no...my numbers are \"perfect\" and despite my symptoms and concerns, my thyroid is not the cause. I have read over and over that normal ranges do not necessarily mean ideal thyroid function. So I thought I'did reach out to you all for your thoughts. Thanks so much in advance and sorry for length. P.S. I also had an ultrasound done due to a strange sensation in my neck and some intermittent difficulty swallowing. Waiting for the report on that.\n",

I just got back some blood tests that show a very, very mild case of borderline hyperthyroidism (normal FT3 and FT4, but slightly low TSH).

      "I recently went to dr. with a list of symptoms that had me concerned about hypothyroidism. I did my research and went in with several tests that I wanted done. He chose to do a TSH, free T4, and total t3. He didn't feel the others were necessary and was certain that my tests would come back normal. My results are: TSH -- .46 (range 0.46-4.68) FreeT4 - .85 (range 0.78-2.19) Total T3 -- 1.06 (range 0.97-1.69) I didn't hear from him for 3 days so I finally called. He said \"yes, all tests were in the normal range\". However, not felling completely comfortable with that and no further offer to explain why I'm loosing my hair, ridiculously aching joints, brain fog, mild depression for years and memory issues, I called the office back to have them fax my results to me. After reviewing the numbers, all were on the low side of normal, with TSH barely \"normal\". And further research looks like the low TSH with other low numbers may indicate hypothyroidism but also an issue with pituitary gland. Can anyone offer guidance or thoughts about my numbers ? Should I be concerned about my numbers being low and should I be consulting with another dr., perhaps and endocrinologist? Is this pituitary a potential concern? Thanks for any input or validation or suggestions.\n",

All she said was that they were \"abnormal\". The ultrasound technician said the results would be read within 24 hours of my appointment, and I am starting to worry. Should it be taking this long, or should I call my doctor and ask? When I had blood drawn the first time, they called me the next day.\n",

      "I am currently waiting for my blood test results to come back. I saw my GP with a whole bunch of symptoms that all sounded pretty pathetic on their own, however it's been really getting down so eventually I made the appointment. For months I have been hot all the time, and it's a different kind of heat, really difficult to describe. I wake up sweating and clammy, I do the smallest of things and it's happening again. It's now got so bad I constantly sit with the fan on, day and night. The heat comes from inside and sometime it washes over me, my neck, my shoulders and my head. I find it really distressing. So, going back to last November I am sat on a train taking my daughter to an appointment. It's mid morning I'm tired, again, I'm always tired, and out of the blue I get the biggest panic ever. I feel sick, I think I'm going mad, and I HAVE to get off the train. Needless to say we never made the trip and I had to be escorted off the train and picked up. For the whole day I'm anxious, I'm worn out and I feel terrible. Truly horrendous. From that day I've never picked up. My appetite has gone down, I feel constantly sick, headaches, heat intolerance, (that's a killer). I don't sleep well at night but I'm quite happy to sleep the day away even though I do not want to. I'm clammy all the time, even after I have showered. I cannot bear the anxiety in the pit of my stomach all the time and then that makes me worse cause I'm convinced I'm going mad. I feel like my whole life is on hold at the moment, I seem to be a complete failure in everything. We cancelled a weekend away just gone because I had another anxiety panic attack and the aftermath left me feeling so ill I just couldn't function. The burning in my stomach is just horrendous. When I do eat I feel sick. But I do eat. I was drying my hair when the panic anxiety kicked in, what's that all about? I was happy feeling tired but ok. Also I've realised that when I'm really over tired my panic gets worse. I can't live like this and I'm worried my GP will say I'm just stressed, so he can't help. I have a very stressful situation right now as my daughter is very ill, and has been for over a year, so I understand that stress doesn't help. my GP said he would test me for hyperthyroidism but my eyes weren't bulging so it can't be! I would like to know if anyone else here has similar symptoms and can put me out of my misery. I'm struggling and I'm convinced I'm going mad. Thanks. Forgot to mention I get a hand tremor to, this seems to be when I'm pretty bad with whatever is going on.\n",
      "I'm 28, male very healthy and clean diet, trycto workout 4-5 days a week 190lbs 5\"10, 13% body fat. But I constantly am exhausted, nauseous, almost dizzy like. I've had all sorts of blood work done, ekgs eveyrhing that you can think of. Found out I had low testosterone and got that taken care of and still am extremely exhausted day in and day out. I honestly don't know what to do any more. I have to get and take testosterone myself along with doing my own blood work because I can't find a doctor that will help me. I live in Indiana so doing my own bloodwork is legal. I've done countless hours of research getting my testosterone levels in check and am currently just dialing in my estrogen. But I can't get over always feeling tired and unhealthy. It's to the point where I can't go to the gym anymore because I'm so physically exhausted that it makes me sick the whole day. Even when I don't go I'm still exhausted and sickly feeling. I don't know what else to do. http://s1382.***********.com/user/modifiedamerican/media/58C0A28D-9EED-4BAB-84DE-70108A691D46_zpsydv8ezcy.jpeg.html\n",
      "TSH .35 (.27-4.2) T4 free .8 (.9-1.7) Prolactin 65.7 (4.8-23.3) I have had high prolactin levels for years along with low tsh. The endo's I have seen insist I have hyperthyroidism and ignore the high prolactin level. My current gynecologist finally says that you can't go off of tsh if you have a pituitary problem (I have had an mri which shows no tumor 8 years ago). I have major hypo symptoms with being extremely cold when everyone else is warm and low energy and extremely tired all the time, also infertility in my 20's and 30's (now 51 years old).

      "Hello everyone. I recently went to the doctor because I thought I was suffering from depression. I was tired all the time, unmotivated, apathetic, and was having sleep problems. I had also gained a significant amount of weight for my stature; I'm around 5'4 and have gone from 112 lbs to 135 lbs in a span of about a year and a half, even though my eating habits are generally the same as they always have been. I assumed that it was just my metabolism slowing down at a normal rate combined with unhealthy college food. My doctor prescribed sertraline aka Zoloft, but also did some blood work. They called me with the results the other day and found that my TSH level was 6.150 and was higher than what is considered normal range, so I'm going back for more tests. I'm concerned because I'm only 19 years old and have been very healthy my entire life, but now there is the possibility of hypothyroidism. At the same time I've read things online suggesting that only a level of 15 and up would actually cause weight gain. What do you guys think? Is my thyroid out of whack?\n",
      "hello everybody! I have recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and from what i've read and heard from others, I basically need a lifestyle change as in my diet needs to completely change. After eating I found myself throwing up about an hour later and having an upset stomach for days after. For the past three weeks I have only been eating fruit, eggs, and meat and some toast and noodles that are gluten free. I'm still not sure what is causing my body to feel so horrible, I think I have celiac disease but i'm still in the process of doing more blood work. For years I have been lethargic and constantly down with nothing to look forward to. I also went to many doctors and dermatologists after my skin started to get a horrible rash that covered my whole body which turns out it was eczema. My eczema only made my depression worse because I felt very self conscious about and it kept me up all night and it never got better even with all the creams and oral prescriptions I was prescribed. After doing more research it seems like all of my symptoms are connected. So lately I have fallen back into this phase of always being sad and turing minor things into a huge deal. I'm just wondering what you all did to help yourselves and what medications helped and what foods you found made you feel the most sick. Really any information regarding hypothyroidism would be helpful!\n",
      "For 5 years I have had extreme problems sleeping and muscle soreness. I went to my PCP numerous times over this, finally the soreness got unbearable, so he sent me to a specialist thinking it was Fibromyalgia. The specialist found my Vitamin D level was 6, extremely deficient and my TSH was 5.7, my T3 and T4 were normal. My PCP gave me 50,000 IU, one a week for 10 weeks, my Vitamin D went to 9. The PCP bloodwork shows my thyroid has been between 5.2 and 7.5 for the last five years, he never mentioned it to me because he said its borderline. I have always consumed a lot of Vitamin D, drank milk daily and eat cereal every morning fortified with Vitamin D. I then took 2,000 IU D3 daily for a month and the level is now 13 and my TSH is still 5.7. I am now sleeping great and have no muscle soreness. I am having a problem absorbing Vitamin D and need to get to at least 30, so I have just started taking 4,000 IU D3 daily. Should I take thyroid medication ? Why am I having a problem getting my vitamin D level higher ? Could there be a problem that is screwing up my thyroid and Vitamin D level ? What else should I have tested ?\n",
      "Hello there Brief introduction. I am a 21 year old male, who has been experiencing some peculiar symptoms for over 3 years now. It started with the odd bout of anxiety that would leave me powerless at times. This has led to periods of exhaustion, hives (when there's cold weather), insomnia, constipation, dry skin and finer hair. 2 years ago I was tested for Hypothyrodism, and my TSH levels came back at 10.0. At the time this seemed quite high, however my doctor wasn't concerned and I never really looked back. 2 years later, I still have the same symptoms and I'm not sure what road to pursue. Should I get tested for Hypo again, if so, what tests should I request in order to ascertain whether or not im Hypo? Thank you\n",
      "Hi all, follow-up lab work ordered plus some additional tests due to muscle/joint pain. My confusion and somewhat worry, lies in the elevated WBC. Do others experience elevations in their WBC labs with hashi's even though inflammation doesn't seem active? ESR and CRP considered to be good markers for inflammation yet both are at the lowest end of the range they could be. I do not have any infections (viral or bacterial) presently. WBC 14.6 (4.0-11.0 xE9/L) Neutrophils 11.0 (2.0-7.5 xE9/L) ESR 2 (2-30 mm/h) CK 31 (33-165 U/L) DSDNA <1 (<5 IU/ml) NEGATIVE Rheumatoid Factor <10 (<14 IU/ml) CRP .5 (<6.0 mg/L) C3 .99 (.90-1.80 g/L) C4 .23 (.15-0.53 g/L) Creatinine 60 (50-100 umol/L) TSH 4.28 (.32-4.00) ANA is still not back yet Since I started Levothyroxine last July, this is my fourth lab so I went back an looked at WBC's on my previous tests. Every time it's been elevated. June, it was 10.3, October 11.3, December 10.8 now jumped to 14.6. Neutrophils followed same pattern.\n",
      "Hi everyone I am a 58 year old male who has been living with a myriad of symptoms pretty much since birth. I have seen dozens of doctors and have been researching the web and health forums for many years without success. I am not sure where to start or even if Im on the correct forum but I have finally decided to post my personal health issues in the hope of someone may able to point me in the right direction. I have lived with blocked sinuses, ears, skin problems (face and shoulders) dry mouth, swollen pale face, coarse dry hair, coughing up mucus, constant throat clearing, difficulty swallowing with a hoarse nasal speech. The doctors have suggested reflux although I very rarely get heartburn. Nausea from changing posture has always been a problem (changing from horizontal to vertical and vice versa) I have always had difficulty concentrating, brain fog and sleeping difficulties (mind racing). I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD and am taking medication which seems to help my concentration but not my physical issues. I have also severe bloating and gas, constipation, alternating diarrhea. I have to lie down in bed for several hours to relieve the pressure and bloating. The inability to urinate properly, dribbling urine (penis and testicles shrunken) and water retention have also been issues. Urine is also very acidic (tried PPIs but end up with a swollen face). Also tried betaine supplements for low stomach acid. I have seen dozens of doctors over the last 30 years, many of whom have dismissed my systems as either all in my head or as IBS. Two doctors advised me to get my medium sized hiatal hernia fixed and ended up with a nissen fundoplication about 5 years ago which made no difference to my symptoms. I have also been to Shands and the Mayo Clinic in Florida. I have been bombarded with prescription drugs and supplements over the years which exacerbate my symptoms, the main one being my face turns pale and swollen. Ive even tried drinking a lot of water to alleviate the water retention and end up with severe bloating and a pale swollen face! Also when I shave I have to live with a pale face for 12 hours. I have had dozens of allergy tests over the years showing many allergies which would change from test to test. I have always been up and down on sugar and a glucose tolerance test was normal and am not diabetic. I have also tried many diets to no avail. I also have had numerous blood tests, colonoscopies and endoscopies which have all been normal. The exception has been bile in my stomach and irritation in my esophagus. Also several abdominal x rays have shown a large pocket of gas in my ascending colon above the ileocecal valve. I get discomfort (bubbling and pressure) in this area immediately after eating. A hydrogen breath test was positive so I was treated with numerous antibiotics and I also requested and received 5 days worth of diflucan. I also failed an autonomic tilt table test at the Mayo clinic. All my symptoms (apart from thinning eyebrows) are consistent with a thyroid problem but my tests (TSH, T3 and T4) have always been normal. I have given up several times over the years but I know the doctors have missed something. Heres why: After being diagnosed with gastroparesis I was advised to eat small meals. All my life Ive always had relief from the exact opposite. In the past Ive found if Im backed up and bloated and eat a large meal and liquids after a while things miraculously start to work as they should. Standing up for many hours also seems to help. It is as if somebody has turned a switch. My sinuses and ears clear, my voice drops, face swelling subsides, face color comes back, hair turns soft and shiny, pass a lot of gas, sudden urge to go to the bathroom and I feel like I cant stop urinating (urine PH is normal). I can even shave without a reaction.I feel on top of the world and can eat and drink anything without any adverse reaction but unfortunately this relief typically only lasts 8 hours. I am suspecting that my lifetime of issues may relate to a nerve, autoimmune or neurological problem. I have got fairly depressed lately and am hoping someone can help me. Sorry for the long post. Richard\n",
      "Hello all, I have been on a long journey of trying to get a diagnosis with my symptoms. I originally went to my Dr. with symptoms assuming they were thyroid related. Of course, he tested only the TSH and it was normal so he wouldn't pursue anything else. Fast forward to another appt in which I mentioned to my doctor, severe headaches (constant, no drug relieves them) and a newly added symptom, leaky breasts. Find out prolactin level was high, ordered a MRI w/wo contrast. Find a microadenoma on the pit. gland AND lesions that indicate possible MS. Go to Neuro-- Lesions aren't normal, get Lumbar Puncture to see if results support an MS dx. LP results show me positive for o-bands but no other abnormal levels typically seen with MS. Neuro says he can't dx with MS, going to have to do another MRI in January. I get a referral to an Endo to deal with the tumor. Just recently saw her and she ordered a full metabolic panel, T4 Free, T3 Total, TSH, Prolactin, and ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE. The results came in today--anyone care to give me their opinion? This whole thing has me exhausted. METABOLIC PANEL SODIUM 137 meq/L POTASSIUM 4.1 meq/L CHLORIDE 102 meq/L CARBON DIOXIDE 28.2 meq/ GLUCOSE 89 mg/dL BUN 9 mg/dL CREATININE 0.8 mg/dL CALCIUM 8.9 mg/dL PROTEIN, TOTAL 6.4 g/dL ALBUMIN 3.4 g/dL BILIRUBIN TOTAL 0.3 mg/dL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE (ALP) 50 U/L 3 AST (SGOT) 6 U/L ALT (SGPT) 8 U/L TSH 6.428 T4 FREE .89 T3 TOTAL 147 PROLACTIN 20.2 EGFR >60\n",

      "Hi All Glad to join. Been reading a lot about Thyroidectomy here and other places. I'm 57 recently and haven't joined a 'help' forum for anything since my Ramsay Hunt Syndrome 8 years ago. It really helped to get support for something only they and very few doctors knew about. But to return to the subject-I joined because I read Tree Frog's story and can absolutely say I was in the same boat basically. I've lost my marriage over it too. Thought I was going crazy. I'm one of those that was never seriously sick in my life (except RHS) until 3 years ago when I had sudden and inexplicable kidney failure! Nephrologist did $35,000 worth of tests and one month of dyalisis of which I was a hairs breadth from becoming a permanent patient. I couldn't understand or except that I-perfectly healthy (so I thot) never had a kidney problem in my life, could sudden kidney failure. I went to emergency because I thot I had food poisoning and couldn't keep anything down after 3 days. For 3 years prior (hind sight) I had a lump I my throat and was afraid to go to the doc for fear of cancer. This story is sooo long I'm trying to shorten it. But in researching why my kidneys failed I came across an Aussie site about reversing my 3rd stage CKD. They said they needed my results of my parathyroid (PTH). Huh? They said that was the place to start to REVERSE my CKD. And so began my research and then I realized much of many other pains and symptoms I'd had were related to my thyroid or parathyroid. They started at age 45 and probably earlier. I had a hysterectomy at 17 five days after the birth of my daughter. (atributed to Von Willebrand Syndrome) another story for another time. Last November I was so ill and in so much pain in my hips, knees, ankles, and feet I was using a cane within months. I've gained 75lbs in less than a year and anxiety. Was on pain meds and anti-anxiety meds. Night sweats. Insomnia. Fatigue all the things you read about in many of these stories as well as the docs that believe borderline is 'ok' etc. I've been on HBP med because of my CKD and in fear of diabetes since I'm 3/8 NA, Irish, and German and have what my life insurance companies blood tests refer to as 'metabolic syndrome' which in layman terms is on the verge of everything from diabetes to a heart attack! I believe in the bodies ability to heal itself given the natural herbs and foods. I've tried it. I don't believe it cutting out fat, carbs, etc. our bodies need everything in balance. I've tried juicing, vegan, gluten free, etc. Nothing helped for long and the weight not only didn't go I gained more. So I understood that insulin was severely affected and again research pointed to my thyroid. At the time I didn't know the difference between the thyroid and the parathyroid and the functions of each. So I found a doc (D. O.) who would not be intimidated by me or my research AND listen to me. So he says it's my thyroid even tho my numbers were normal and I said, no it's my parathyroid because of my kidney failure (primary Hyperparathyroidism) So we do agree to go to an Ear, nose & throat. Well, we were both right. I had HYPERparathyroidism and HYPOthyroidism. I had a peanut shaped (unshelled size) on my parathyroid. So on December 1st, 2016 I had 2-1/2 hour surgery to remove it. INSTANTLY I HAD NO MORE BONE PAIN! For 7 years my parathyroid had been going full blast pulling calcium from my bones that my kidneys could not process and therefore causing my anxiety, depression, neuropathy and GERD just to mention a few of the things that caused me. Seven days later-feeling better- she says my calcium was 141 (should be 10-12) dropped to 70. Good news? The adenoma is gone. Bad news? Another PT has grown into my thyroid causing the walnut sized lump I thought she took out! That's the one I felt. That's the one causing hypothyroidism! What? Another surgery she says. Right away. Now. K. So I've lost the right side of my thyroid because I refused full thyroidectomy. She also took another suspicious parathyroid leaving me one. You cannot live without it and there's to med to substitute it. If you lose all you must have a transplant in you arm or neck and hope it works. I say this because the one I have has been 'off' for over 7 years and is trying hard to work. I ended up in emergency and 5 days on IV calcium just to get to 6.5. I'm taking 3 different kinds of calcium just so it doesn't feel like my arms, hands, legs and feet don't cramp and constantly tingle. It feels like dogs biting my legs. My fingers curl up when I try to pick things up. It's January 19th! I have insomnia and night sweats worse than menopause! Yes I have ovaries so I did go thru menopause. Today my doc gave me Levothyroxin. I start in the morning and I'm scared to take it. I've also order Thyrobid off ****** with 152 good reviews from people on meds too. I will use the natural first. I'll let you know how it turns out and which I end up on. Thanx for listening. Nice to meet you!\n",
      "Hello. I am new to this site. Just looking for some insight or advice. I've been diagnosed with a Goiter more than 12 years ago. Never been on any meds for it. Labs always came back fine for the thyroid. Hormone levels are out of wack one visit. Next visit they're fine. Since 2006 I've been having muscle pains, fasiculations, headaches, tiny bruises on my arms and legs. Hot flashes. I have arthritis in both knees. Md's always tell me those are the signs of getting old. I'm only 37 years old. That's when I know it's time to find a new doctor. Had this one MD tell me If he doesn't find anything soon they are going to presciribe antidepressants. I've been to many Endocrinologists, Rheumatologists, Neurologists.

      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "Good morning, I am in the process of changing my Levothyroxin to Armour. Can anyone tell me how to safely convert from Levothyroxin to Armour. I have been on Levothyroxin 75mcg daily and I told my doctor I wanted to switch to Armour. He prescribed for me Armour 30mg and I know the conversion chart indicates that if a person is one Levothyroxin 75mcg daily, Armour 45 mg should be taken. My doctor has asked me to try the 30mg Armour and to come back to have my TSH checked in 6 weeks. I have been taking 30mg Armour daily and I am lightheaded, my pulse dips into the low to mid-50's at night and I have had chest pressure and my appetite is not very good. Since I was on Levothyroxin and stopped it two weeks ago to take Armour, after reading how to safely change from Levothyroxin to Armour, it looks as though a person should be taking both initially and that there is a weaning process that should take place. Because I feel horrible on the Armour 30mg daily and after reading that there should be a weaning of the Levothryroxin I have decided, based on the conversion chart to take the Armour 30mg daily and also take Levothyroxin 25mcg daily to make up for the 60mg Armour that it says in the conversion chart. I just started today to add the Levothyroxin to make up the difference based on the conversion chart so I might feel better. I did notice that Armour takes affect within days of starting on it, which I find interesting. NOt like Levothyroxin where it takes weeks. Does anyone have experience with converting from Levothyroxin to Armour? And what is the correct way to change from Levothyroxin to Armour? To get me through to the 6 week re-check of my TSH, I have added the Levothryoxin 25mcg to make up for what I should be on according to the conversion chart and in hopes of my symptoms subsiding. At the point of my 6 week TSH re-check I will let my doctor know what I am on. Any help with this would be appreciated.\n",
      "My son (now age 13) was diagnosed with Hashimoto's about a year ago. At the time, he also started having severe pure-O OCD: very disturbing persistent intrusive thoughts. He has been treated for the Hashi's with levothyroxine, but I kept thinking the dose wasn't high enough. I wanted his TSH under 3, but the endo was fine as long as it was under 5.5. I have been pushing for more levo, and we finally got his TSH down to 3, and the obsessive thoughts, which had plagued him daily for a year, are completely gone (it's been five weeks). They disappeared a few weeks after his latest levo increase. So I wonder if there's a connection between hypothyroidism and OCD. Has anyone else experienced this? I should also explain that at the same time we upped my son's levothyroxine, we started him on NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine). The psychiatrist thought that his obsessive thoughts, which began abruptly, might have been an autoimmune reaction that began at the same time as his Hashi's (and for the same reason--he had Norovirus). This is PANS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome, similar to PANDAS). The psychiatrist prescribed the NAC for the PANS. Well, something worked a miracle for my son. For a year, he never went more than a few hours without his waking nightmares. He has been 100% happy and healthy for five weeks now. It's easy to assume the NAC was a miracle cure for the PANS, but I want to make sure I've considered everything I can, in case his problem recurs in the future. Thanks, Abby\n",
      "OK I'm at a loss and hoping to hear from others that have the same symptoms as me. I'm 38 and seriously having a hard time. I've gained 40 pounds in 6 months, fatigue, hair loss, hair not growing (not even an inch in 2 years) acne just started, freezing all the time, constipation no bowel movements for like 6 and 7 days at a time and very little relief from laxatives, bloated, it hurts to wear anything tight on my waist, no energy. I've been to my doctor repeatedly for all this and he's checked my thyroid about 6 times and he always tells me it's normal. I'm at a loss everyone thinks I'm a hypochondriac including my husband.

My fT4 today: 28 pmol/l, TSH: 0.05 I have read a lot about it but didn't find content about the diet which is best in the hyperthyroid phase. If you have previous experiences I would be grateful to hear it. My doctor suggested propranolol because of the high fT4. I do not have rapid heart beats, maybe sometimes tremors.

      "Hello everyone, i'll try to make this as short as possible! BACKGROUND: I'm a 23 yo female and I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (non-autoimmune) when I was 21. My TSH was a 6.4 and I felt horrible. For the first year, I was on Levothyroxine (Synthroid) and while my TSH dropped to a 2.7, I still felt awful. I started having depressive tendencies I never had before, along with not being able to concentrate clearly/not memorizing things as quickly as before,low energy and a bloated face. I basically felt the same as before the medication if not worse. I do thorough research and am a very holistic person. I eat an unprocessed mediterannean diet, exercise every day lifting weights/running/or practicing yoga. I did have weight gain through this year and a half while keeping my eating and exercise habits the same, about 30 lbs (while on the Levothyroxine). However I was a bit underweight to start so I didn't get to an unhealthy weight, rather it put me in the upper-end of normal BMI range. I was very fed up with how I was feeling and how my body was reacting, and my doctor refused to test my free T3 and free t4. She wasn't listening to my symptoms and was ruled by the TSH. I found a really great endo this summer that put me on Nature-throid (comparable to Armour). After going on Nature-throid, I feel much much better, but still not optimal. My most recent lab values are as follows.. TSH: 0.08 (range: 0.4-4.5) Free T4: 0.9 (range: 0.8-1.8) Free T3: 2.6 (range: 2.3-4.2) From what I've read, patients start feeling optimal when their FT3 gets into the upper third quadrant of the range. My Free T3 used to be a 2.3, and even it raising from a 2.3 to a 2.6 I felt a major difference. It's my goal to get my FT3 up into an optimal range. While my TSH is \"low\" according to the range, I still have hypothyroid symptoms. I have had absolutely no hyper symptoms that would make me think I am overmedicated. I still suffer from stalled weight loss (when actively eating well/exercising), bloating, coldness, and major fatigue. All of these have improved greatly since switching to Nature-throid but they are still issues for me. My doctor thinks it's fine my TSH is this low, because I don't feel hyper, but doesn't want to raise my medication. I however think I am SO CLOSE to feeling like myself again. I feel better with every dosage increase. Has anyone else experienced a very low TSH but also low free t3/t4? Is TSH useful once a patient is on a combined t3/t4 therapy? I am not discrediting the TSH test. I've just read that TSH is useful until one is on a combined ft3/ft4 therapy, and then dosing really depends on symptoms, and the free t3/t4 numbers and where they fall in the range. Thank you all for your time!\n",
      "Hello All This is my first post. I've had thyroid nodules for over 15 years with annual ultrasounds and several FNA. All was well until August 2016 when I began to feel ill. It was discovered through an Uptake scan that I have a hot nodule. 0 TSH and slightly elevated Free T4. I don't have the results of my current blood work from 1/5/17 but the doctor phoned and said the Free T4 rose again slightly. He ordered 10 mg of mechlizine and return to him in 4 months. My question is to anyone who has dealt with a hot nodule (I have more than one nodule but only one is hot per the uptake scan which was of normal uptake other than to that one nodule) what is the best treatment? R131 or surgery? I have read you cannot remain on mechlizine long term due to possible liver damage. The doctor gave me these options but advises R131 and gave me meds while I decide. Also - I have read that a virus can affect your thyroid. I had a 2 week flu in December and was just recovering when I had this blood work. Could that affect the rise in T4? Thank you for any help you can offer Jaye\n",
      "Hello, I am a 18 (soon to be 19) year old college student. Before I went to college I went and got some blood work done in the summer. When the results came back, it said my TSH was 5.6 (or 5.6123, something like that, 5.6 and some numbers) and my cholesterol was high (I don't remember the exact numbers, I just remember the doctor telling me it was above average). The doctor immediately put me on some hormone replacement, saying that I have hypothyroidism. I've been on it for about 5 months. The thing that bothers me is that even though the doctor diagnosed me with hypothyroidism, I really didn't have any of the symptoms before my diagnosis. I was never fatigued, my weight was stable until my first semester of college (freshman 15 lol). The only symptom that I had was high cholesterol, but for the 2 or 3 blood tests (past 2 or 3 years), my cholesterol was either slightly above average, or average but borderline above average. Should I try to push my doctor to do more testing or is my blood test alone a good indication of my hypothyroidism?\n",

      "Hi there, I had an ultrasound on my neck and here are the results; I have a 3.5 cm nodule. early well circumscribed in my thyroid and there was no adjacent adenopathy but they are recommending a FNA to test for cancer. My T4 and T3 came back normal....am very worried as they are as by the size. Any suggestion....am so nervous\n",
      "Hi everyone! Newbie here, so I need some of your advice. I've had a year of crazy symptoms: temperature issues (cold or hot all the time), weight gain, joint pain, mood swings, brain fog, and serious FATIGUE. Thyroid issues (specifically hypothyroidism) runs in my family. Both my mother and grandmother have had their thyroids removed so it's always one of my usual suspects. However, I've had a bunch of thyroid tests + thyroid antibody tests run and everything looks normal. Fast forward to about a month ago when a doctor told me that they thought I had a thyroid nodule. They sent me for an ultrasound. On my right lobe I have 5 nodules- two that are over 1 cm and three under 1 cm. Not too worrysome. I have another on my isthmus, which is also thickened. However on my left lobe I have a nodule measuring in at 6.7 cm x 3.7 cm x 4.5 cm. The doctor wants it to come out. I went to the throat surgeon yesterday and he thinks they may have mis-measured it or it's grown...he estimated it at 8 cm!!!! He said it was one of the largest he's seen. It's been fine needle aspirated and has come back benign- thanks goodness. I'm setting up an appt to get a left lobectomy. So my question- could this giant nodule (i've nicknamed it Shelldon, since it's about the size of an egg) be causing all of my crazy symptoms, even if my Thyroid tests come back normal? Also do you have any recommendations or advice about lobectomy surgery? Anything I need to know? Any ideas of what could cause all these nodules? I know that nodules are super common but it just feels like I've got a lot and they're weirdly big...iodine deficiency??? Thanks in advance\n",

      "Just curious, my TSH normally runs between 1.05 and 1.18 this is something my doctor checks with every yearly check up I have. Then almost 2 months ago I found a mass in my neck which led to surgery and a partial thyroid removal a month ago. That week my doctor ordered the TSH blood work to check my levels and they have jumped to 2.98 could this just be the result of having part of my thyroid removed or Hypothyroidism?\n",
      "Good morning, Can anyone tell me how to properly convert from Levothyroxin to Armour. I recently asked my doctor to switch my Levothyroxin to Armour. I was on Levothyroxin 75mcg daily and my doctor ordred Armour 30mg daily. After three or four days on the Armour dose I have had brain fog, heart rate in the low to mid 50's at night, decreased appetite(which I do not mind) and chest pressure at times. I do not have a heart condition, however I think my heart rate dipping into the 50's is too low and does not allow proper perfusion to occur, thus the chest pressure at times. From what I have read when converting from a T4 medication such as Levothyroxin to Armour, it needs to be weaned. Is that true? I would think it would be safer. Also the conversion chart indicates that I should be on 45mg of Armour and not 30mg as my doctor ordered. That I do not like. Since I have had the symptoms I mentioned above, I decided to give myself the equivalent of what I should get based on the conversion chart, so I just today after 10 days of putting up with the symptoms decided to add 25mcg of Levothyroxin to provide me with the dose indicated on the conversion chart, which should be 45mg of Armour. My TSH will be re-checked in another month and at that time I will let my doctor know that I added the small amount of Levothryoxin to make up for what I should have according to the conversion chart. Any help with how one should go about converting would be appreciated.\n",

      "Hi everyone, I am new to this site and just learning about hypothyroidism. I recently started having a weird symptom (after months of fatigue, anxiety, and malaise). I started abruptly having a feeling of pulsating and muscle twitching in my legs, mainly, and left arm. It is really scary and keeps me up for hours at night. My doctor did a thyroid test and my TSH is 7.98 and my free T4 is 0.9. The doctor just put me on 50 mcg Synthroid and basically said hypothyroidism can do a lot of weird things and is probably causing the pulsating/twitching thing and should resolve with the thyroid meds and didn't seem very concerned. I've still been worried because my T4 is in the low normal range and I haven't seen much online about these specific leg twitching symptoms related to hypothyroidism. The pulsating/muscle twitching is very terrifying and makes it so hard to sleep-I get scared it could be something bad like MS or ALS, especially since it started so abruptly. I was wondering (1) if anyone has had a high TSH and low normal T4 like this and it still indicates hypothyroidism, and (2) if anyone has had a similar problem with the pulsing/twitching in their legs? Thanks so much for your help!\n",
      "Hi everyone! I am new here, so I hope I am doing this right. I am hoping for some different opinions on my current thyroid situation. In 2012 I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and put on 50mcg synthroid. My tsh was 9.9. I went to the doctor because it felt like my thyroid was swollen, and sure enough I was hypo at the time. I had a cat scan in April of 2012 and have always been suspicious of the iodine maybe causing my thyroid issues, or revealing them as well as quitting smoking in March of that year. Fast forward to August 2016 I had another cat scan due to an ovarian cyst rupture and they wanted to rule out appendicitis. Two weeks later I began to have hot flashes and tingling in the hands and feet as well as a terrible headache. I thought I was going hyperthyroid. My pcp disagreed, didn't test my thyroid and tried me on Armour thyroid which put me through the roof with anxiety and panic attacks and hyper symptoms. I went off my synthroid and all meds and have been off of them since October 5 2016. My pcp said I probably never had a thyroid problem to begin with( He has now been fired). I now feel wretched, I am very dizzy, weak, fatigued, trouble breathing, inflamed thyroid, body aches, vision problems, low mood etc. I have had to lay down after eating and have been bedridden for a few weeks now. However my tsh is just now 3.41, ft4 is 1.24, and ft3 is 3.00. All normal range. My endocrinologist says to go back on synthroid. I took 50mcg yesterday and woke up with a headache, so I took 25mcg this morning. My worry is the normal thyroid levels and having anxiety after taking synthroid and drinking coffee this morning. I felt anxious until about 1:30pm. I felt pretty weird, but I did notice my body aches are better and I'm more alert, but still fatigued. I was al so able to process meals much better. Some of this could be mental as I've been through the ringer these last four months and am scared to death of going hyperthyroid again. Has anyone gone on synthroid with normal thyroid levels and been fine?\n",
      "About 10 months ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism with a TSH of 6.8. t4 and t3 were normal. I was tested for antibodies and they were normal which means my hypothyroidism was not caused my autoimmune disease. Regardless I went on the meds and started feeling better. Cold hands, depression, night sweats all went away and I started to have more energy. However my hair loss has only worsened and I'm putting on more weight dispite doing normal exercise and eating a healthy diet. On a side note I've also been on birth control for 15 years. My Endocrinologist said that's it's possible that stress and birth control could have brought on my hypothyroidism seeing as it was not immune related. So hearing this I was super eager to stop my birth control. I stopped BC in September and have only had 2 periods since then that were 46 and 40 days apart and only last 2 days. To top it off my hair loss is worse and I weigh the most I ever have despite feeling better! I'm so frustrated and wonder if I should just stop my synthroid and see if my body naturally repairs itself with healthy diet exercise and supplements now that I've stopped bc. I feel like my hair loss and weight have been caused by the synthroid and is now being exasperated from stopping the birth control pill. If my hypothyroidism isn't caused by autoimmune is it possible to cure it naturally without synthroid?? If anyone has any comments or similar stories please let me know. I'm beginning to think I will soon be bald if I don't figure this out! Thx\n",

      "I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1992, and had my thyroid removed. I have taken Synthroid every since and have done just fine. Currently taking 150 mcg daily, and also take 5 mg daily of Lexapro. I have noticed some what of a dry mouth in the last few years and was wondering if Synthroid could be the cause of that. Has anyone else experienced this when taking Synthroid? One piece of advice to any Synthroid takers, don't ever buy Synthroid from Canada or any other country. Ten years ago I did this to save a little $, and ended up having significant heart palpations. It turned out the Synthroid that I had purchased from Canada was three years old and had lost its effectiveness.\n",
      "Hi all! I've had Hashimotos for about 10 years. I was diagnosed after the birth of my first daughter. I was depressed and couldn't sleep. I'm so thankful my doctor checked my thyroid before doing anything else. After starting on levothyroxine I felt like my old self - no symptoms at all for 9 years. I've had 3 other children since then. About a year and a half ago after I stopped nursing my youngest and my cycle came back - I went crazy. I was SO depressed, anxious, heart racing, my hair was falling out, I couldn't sleep at all - days at a time with no sleep at all. My TSH was always \"in range\". After almost a year of this - back in October I finally went to an endocrinologist who increased my dosage slightly and put me on name brand synthroid. After 6 weeks I noticed almost all of my symptoms went away. I still would have the occasional bout of insomnia - usually related to my cycle. I could deal with it though. NOW its been about 2 weeks of everything coming back full force. Terrible insomnia, anxiety, depression. I just finished my cycle - and the symptoms still haven't gone away. My endo suggested Cytomel - I just took my first dose this morning: 2.5 mg. I've been SO dizzy, and spaced out - almost like I'm drunk. Has anyone else experienced this? It is a normal side effect? My doctor told me to give it a few days. I would love to hear others experiences with Cytomel : did it help/not help you. I would even just love some encouragement! I know all of my symptoms are common with hypothyroidism. It's just been awful feeling like I'll never be normal again. I'm considering an antidepressant and birth control as well. I REALLY don't want to do either of those, but I am desperate to be normal! I need to be a mama to my four girls! Thanks!\n",

      "Been tested for everything under the sun, double scopes that ruled out Celiac disease, but still having severe symptoms. I read somewhere that most Drs don't do the full panel test for thyroid so I wrote it all down and got mine to order the blood test. He said that the TSH was normal but the TPO levels, which should be 60 at the highest were 1,037! Is this very high? He recommended I see an endo (I see him this week), and that it's possibly endo related. I am reading about Hashi's and think there is a good possibility that may be it. Are there other causes that include high TPO'? I have had severe insomnia (1-2hrs per night only and feel restless and need to move once awake), joint pain, weight gain, dry skin/lips, sore swollen throat and hoarse voice, frequent urination, diarrhea multiple times a day, fatigue, anxiety and depression, stomach aches, bloating and no libido. Got sent to a gastroenterologist who said he couldn't find anything wrong and remarked, \"You're a nervous anxious kind of person aren't you?\" He agreed with my GP that the next step should be anti depressants because that could be the cause of all my symptoms. This was before the TPO blood test results though. Should I be on thyroid medication even if the TSH is normal just based on TPO alone? Anybody have TPO's this high and found symptom relief? Also is it possible to have these symptoms and it not be the fault of gluten or dairy? Everything I read blames Gluten but the symptoms, especially the diarrhea, comes and goes and doesn't seem to follow any straight food direction.\n",
      "I finally figured out after 15 years of intermittent nausea and vomiting, and then 6 months of solid nausea and vomiting, that it could be the Synthroid that I take. Not the doctors...me.

I can't take Armour because I have celiac disease and Armour has gluten in it. My questions are, how long will it be until I get the Synthroid out of my system and is it levothyroxine that people are allergic to?\n",

      "I think I originally posted this question in the wrong forum, I am new here & still getting used to navigating the board so please don't remove this as a double post, I apologize! This is the forum here that I wanted to post this, sorry bout that. The board I used to be on, Anxiety Zone, was shut down recently, was on there for over a year, so I'm brand spanking new here. I see that it says my \"join date\" was in 2003, I don't even remember doing that, I must have registered years ago and never posted, not sure. Hi, I am new here. I am 42 years old, female, married & a mom. I have been having a hard time finding info online, aside from the scary stuff from medical websites. I've been a hypochondriac since I was a teen however I'm not as bad as I used to be when I was younger, but I still worry of course. I don't know much about the thyroid and I have a feeling what I think I'm seeing isn't really my thyroid but not sure. I thought I had seen a bump on my throat when I tiled my head back but I can't tell if it's normal parts of the throat or not. I felt the area & I feel a hard little thing but I can't tell if it's actually my adams apple that I'm feeling, it moves up & down when I swallow and talk and if I tense up my neck it looks like it goes even lower when tensing. I read the thyroid is below the adams apple & above the collarbone area & trying to find it has been difficult, everything I read said I'd feel a butterfly shaped thing which I don't, or maybe I do and I'm not feeling the right spot. When I'm not tilting my head back I don't think I see a bump, of course the longer you stare at it you'll see anything & I don't want to be obsessive about it. I have lost weight but I was trying to lose weight anyway. I noticed my hair on my head was thinning but I also use a flat iron every day which pulls hairs & has been causing split ends. My eyelashes, on the bottom, have gotten shorter but are still there they haven't necessarily all fallen out. My eyebrows look fine. I read the symptoms online but nothing really describes anything I've experienced. I don't have intolerance for hot or cold, I don't feel a lump when I swallow, etc. Am i feeling the adams apple or normal cartilage? I always thought thyroid swelling, or a nodule, would present in the little hollow space between the collarbones? My mother has benign nodules on her thyroid & her mother had her thyroid removed. About 9 years ago I have full bloodwork which also checked my thyroid function & it came back normal. I don't want to drive myself nuts with staring at my neck in the mirror and not even sure what I'm supposed to be seeing or feeling??? Of course I worry about thyroid cancer. My husband looked & said he does see something but he said he's not sure if that's a normal part of the throat & he told me not to worry about it. I think I've had that hard thing I'm feeling for quite a long time but I always don't go around feeling my neck up either, basically I'm clueless on what I'm supposed to be feeling vs what I'm not supposed to be feeling.\n",

I had a thyroidectomy to address papillary cancer in April. I am a 48 year old male and weigh 240#. 4 months ago, when I was on 175 mcg of levothyroxine . . . TSH: 0.07 fT4: 1.6 (0.8-1.8) fT3: 3.7 (2.3-4.2) I understand those thyroid numbers to be ideal for someone who has had thyroid cancer, but I had steadily escalating hypothyroid symptoms since the thyroidectomy. The worse was fatigue, but I also had broad muscle pain with intense pain in the thighs. At the time of the above tests, I was down to working 20 hours per week. Currently I am on 2.5 grains of DPT.

      "I'm 61. I was diagnosed with Hashi's in 2008. I take Armour thryroid 60 mg. Long story short back in April neck pain was ultrasounded and indicated nodules. I was prescribed cortisone for thryroiditis. Labs were in the normal range. Results were TSH 0.55 (ref range 0.45-4.50) T3 (free) 4.7 (ref range 2.0-4.8) T4 (thyroxine) 7.4 (ref range 4.5-12.5) Labs done at Sonora Quest and apparently differ from ref ranges at Lab Corp. In Nov. a new ultrasound didn't indicate anything markedly different. Possible growth of the nodules but slight enough to be uncertain. Labs were completely different. Unfortunately LabCorp doesn't give a ref range just flags low, normal and high. TSH 4.0 normal T3 serum 271 high T3 4.8 high T4 free 0.62 low The endo changed my meds to 1/2 Armour (30 mg) and put my on synthroid 50 mg. to raise the T4. I feel like I'm having side effects, but I'm willing to live through them if I can feel good on a regular basis with some combination. Is it typical that the labs would change like that? It's never been my experience. If I understand Hashi's correctly the thyroid spits out either too little or too much thyroid. Does that happen slowly, quickly? Enough to notice? If that's correct, can symptoms change rapidly? There are days when I feel crippling anxiety for hours, then it just subsides later in the day. I'll have semi normal days. GI issues, fogginess and fatigue come and go. There are days when I feel absolutely great so I know I'm in there somewhere. I'd appreciate some feedback to help me understand the results. Thank you\n",

Add in Cytomel with Synthroid? - try dosing 2x's day? What is the long term damage of using Cytomel?

      "I was recently told my TSH level was elevated at 6.6. I had gone in on 11/29 with concerns that my period had drastically changed since the previous month. It went from being its usually heavy cycle to being super light to the extent I required no pads or tampons. I was concerned I might have been pregnant. The only abnormal on my labs was my TSH. Since then, I have continued to have symptoms of pregnancy despite being told my blood test was negative and all HPT I have taken at home being negative. I am super exhausted, had a fainting spell while out shopping, heartburn, hiccoughs, gas, queasiness on/off, sensitivity to smells, pelvic pain, breast tenderness and enlargement and also generalized itching which I chalked up to my antidepressant. I am not sure what is exactly going on. I have 3 children so I know how it feels to be pregnant and this feels the same. Anyone else been in this same situation? Can an elevated TSH cause all of the symptoms I am having? My doctor is doing follow up testing on my thyroid and I also plan to test for pregnancy again next week.\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "In June of this year I had a thyroid storm and was put on 100 mg of atenolol after my levels dropped I was lowered to 25 mg. I was then lowered to 12.5 and then told to get off atenolol. After 10 days of being off atenolol my hr jumped up to 164 and I ended up in the Dr. I took 12.5 mg of atenolol and was fine. I decided to taper off and got down to 6.25 a couple of weeks ago my endocrinologist said to get off the atenolol. After getting checked out by a cardiologist I was ok to be off it. So I think ok 3.125 mg if atenolol for a few days then got off it. I was off it for 6 days when my hr jumped to 133. I called my cardiologist who said get back on the atenolol and see him next month. I decided I do not want to go back in atenolol but it's kind of dang if I do and dang if I don't so as of right now I'm in 3.125 mg of it. I have a pain in my rib which the dr did X-ray and ultra sound in and there's no reason to be. I'm dead tired I get short of breath. My heart sometimes palpatates but not like before. My legs are weak. My thyroid levels are normal and have been. I was vitamin d. Deficient but have taken supplements. I am eating a healthy diet and have removed soda for several months now. Anyone else experience this? All I want to do is be off this drug!\n",
      "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 18 months ago. Ice cold hands and feet, low body temp, always tired. 6'0 male, 220 pounds. TSH was in the high 6 range. Placed on .25mcg of synthroid. Over the last 18 months, they have raised my dose up to 1.125 because my TSH HAS not dropped below 5.0. My doctor finally tested all my levels and i just got the results. T3= 1.5 ng/ml (normal range .8 to 2.0), T4= .9 ng/dl (.8 to 1.8) and TSH = 6.27 With these results, today he raised it one more level, I think to 1.138, hoping it will help. I have not seen an improvement yet on meds. Getting frustrated!!!!\n",
      "I went to a doc in the box for what I thought was strep. He thought my thyroid felt enlarged and sent me for an Ultrasound scan. I had been battling a cold for a few weeks so I assumed there was some inflammation. Just got the scan result that rec FNA because of a complex nodule over the median and left node. There was also a 1cm nodule on the right side that he didn't rec for biopsy. - I don't have an endocrinologist and guess that will be the next step? Why is a complex nodule need FNA? I have the other finding but it was multi nodules on both sides. Any suggestions?\n",
      "After a total thyroidectomy, my endocrinologist put me on 200 mcg levothyroxine. Exactly 6 weeks after the procedure, my TSH was 0.05 (0.4-4.5) and my Free T4 was 2.1 (0.8-1.8). By that time I had developed leg pain, primarily in the thighs. Based on those TSH/T4 numbers, my endocrinologist decreased my dosage to 175 mcg. Based on similar numbers 9 weeks later (TSH still 0.05, Free T4 was 1.7), he decreased my dosage to 150 mcg. IMO, my symptoms escalated more rapidly at the 150 mcg dosage. At the end of the 15 weeks on levo, I had muscle pain (thighs,back,neck,shoulders), difficulty concentrating and severe fatigue. I got a second opinion from an out-of-network endo I had seen a couple of years earlier when I was on a PPO. He generally agreed with the 1st endos actions, but after some pleading I was able to convince him to let me try Armour/NatureThroid. I have been on it for the past 3 months with moderately good results. The fatigue is 90% gone, the concentration is ~50% better and the muscle pain is ~30% better. I am on my 3rd endocrinologist (trying to get back in-network) and he told me last week that he wanted to return me to levothyroxine because he does not believe in T3 (dessicated or synthetic) treatment as a long term strategy. I am relatively confident that the 200 mcg levothyroxine dosage is insufficient. So my question . . . if I take a larger dosage (say 225 mcg) and my TSH is < 0.05 and my Free T4 is > 2.1, should my endocrinologist prioritize the TSH/T4 numbers above my symptoms? Thank you! I really do not want to relive my experiences from the summer. If I can ignore the TSH/FreeT4 numbers, then that would give me some hope that there is a positive outcome for me at the end of the levothyroxine path.\n",
      "Long story short I was diagnosed with Hashimotos earlier this year after discovering I had elevated TPOAb and finally convinced someone to treat me after being symptomatic for years. My doctor prescribed 25 mcg of T4 and man, do I feel TIRED. I am considerably more tired than I was before I started. I am a subclinical case, as my tsh was only 2.2., but I had my TSH taken again after being on the meds for a few weks and now it has gone up to 3.43. What is going on here? Has anyone else felt MORE tired after starting on thyroid medication? What did you do to fix the problem? Am I on too low of a dose? Do I just need to give it more time? My heart rate has also gone up and I get palpitations but i am not hyperthyroid as confirmed by blood work...I'm just getting more hypo. Edit: ALL vitamin levels are optimal All B's including b-12, D, magnesium, and iron (ferritin too)\n",
      "So my symptoms began when I became pregnant 12 years ago. I immediately became super sick; 12-15 times a day sick. The symptoms continued between and during babies two and three. Every time I ate I almost immediately became ill. Throughout many procedures and tests the only conclusions found were that I have borderline Gastroparesis and \"stomach migraines\". The GI doctors believe that my nerve endings in my stomach are over reacting to food and therefore I dispell the food within the hour, or sometimes longer. So why would I put this on an Endocrinology site? Well, those are where my symptoms began. I would get bloated, sick, food and or medicine not digesting for hours...and then about two years ago my throat started to feel like there was a lump in it. My doctor felt it and found that it was swollen and sent me in for an ultrasound with some testing. All blood work seemed normal, but my bilirubin was elevated. The ultrasound however showed what they explained as many nodules...an abnormal amount, but all looked benign. So they said to continue to watch them every 6 months and while I had those same symptoms multiple times all tests were the same, including the TSH blood work. Well, two years later now my creatine levels spiked as well and while doing research I couldn't help but think about getting more thyroid testing done. So I asked to have the T3 and T4 levels checked and both were high. Not off the charts high, but over the \"limit\". My TSH levels have always been on the lower end. Here's the thing though...I feel like I have more symptoms of hypothyroidism then the hyperthyroidism. I can't get into any doctors for 3+ months so I'm wondering if anyone had this experience? Or maybe some education that would help?\n",
      "Ok, so I have several questions. I was feeling lightheaded and still am (minorly) and decided to get some blood work done. Everything came back normal except my free T4 which was slightly elevated. I read that the normal range is .7 to 1.9 ~ mine is 1.82, so I am within normal range according to that. However, according to the lab I used the normal range is .82-1.77 ~ so I am slightly elevated. Below are some of my thyroid results: Free T3: 3.9 Free T4: 1.82 TSH: 1.76 Should I at all be worried about these results? My Free T3 and TSH are perfectly normal with my Free T4 slightly elevated according to this particular lab references. I went to see a physician assistant and when she interpreted the results she wanted to refer me to an endocrinologist. Should I really have to go to a specialist when all but one lab are off? Are these levels indicative of hyperthyroidism? I would also like to add that I still feel slightly lightheaded, my resting pulse is sometimes 90, and I have slight tremors. I haven't had any of my vitamin levels tested and am thinking that I am low in something on that end which would explain the few symptoms I have been having. I would very much appreciate if some light was shed on this because I can't really seem to find anything on normal TSH and free T3 levels with an elevated free T4 result.\n",
      "Hi, I have searched all over the Internet for results similar to mine and have found nothing. I went to the doctor because I was experiencing lightheadedness and she ordered a full blood work up for me. Everything on my blood work came back fine except for my free T4 level which was slightly elevated. Is this indicative of hyperthyroidism? I'm so scared because I've read nothing but horror stories after horror stories of treating this disorder. I've read that people get huge and that their eyes bulge and just all these other horrible side effects and I'm quite terrified. Labs: Free T4: 1.82 (.7-1.77) TSH: 1.76 Free T3: 3.9 Some insight or reassurance would be greatly appreciated! My Anxiety is through the roof. By the way, the physician assistant who interpreted my labs wanted to refer to an endo, which is highly concerning to me.\n",
      "Hi All, I will post my labs if they are of use to anyone, but my story in a nutshell is that I have high TPO antibodies and a high TSH, all other thyroid results are normal. Three times now I've tried to start Synthroid 25 mcg, and this latest time I started with 12.5 mcg for a week, then moved to 25 mcg every morning, but each and every time I get to week 4 or 5 some terrible insomnia kicks in! Can any of you experts tell me if the insomnia is a passing side effect, and if I should try to press forward with the Synthroid despite the insomnia? Or should I run away from the Synthroid use, screaming with my arms flailing?! I should also note that a month ago I was diagnosed with low ferritin, my level was a 6. Hemoglobin still ok at 12. I am on iron supplements (ferrous fumerate 2x day) but have yet to see a real improvement in the dizziness. BOTTOM LINE: I'm trying to give the Synthroid a shot to see if it helps with my super heavy periods, because I don't know if I have a fighting chance of healing the ferritin problem with a thyroid problem that is potentially causing heavy period problems! But the insomnia, ugh! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. THANK YOU, ThyroidRose\n",
      "Hello! I have a,\"What's your take on adding a bit of Cytomel to Erfa\" question-- I've been on Erfa for 3 years--it corrects my TSH only-- It gets TSH down to 1.0, but FT4 is about 2 points *below* the bottom of the scale and FT3 is consistently at the lowest number of the scale. Current dose: 3, 60mg Erfa (desiccated) pills/day The challenge: Synthroid is a no-go, heart palps & vivid nightmares Erfa can't correct FT4/FT3 and once a year I go hypo and have to increase the dose Is it worth adding the lowest dose, 2.5 of Cytomel? Caffeine-wise (just to see if others react like I do :-)--coffee gives me heart palps but decaf coffee, matcha tea, and dark chocolate do not. I figure if you react the same, your drug reactions and mine may be similar, too. :-)\n",
      "Paging all experts: I have a high TSH (10) and high TPO antibodies (138) but normal numbers of everything else. EVERY TIME I TRY TO START UP Synthroid I get anxious and insomnia kicks in around the 4 week mark, so it must be reaching optimal levels and thus the problems kick in. Can anyone suggest ANYTHING to me that would help me - my doctor wants me to continue to take half of a 25 mcg a day but even that isn't helping me to sleep at night. Do I need to try another T4 med? Or has anyone ever tried to go to half a tablet every other day? Any feedback would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!\n",

      "Hey guys so just wondering ive been to my doctors because I was having these super fatigue symptoms, dry skin and not feeling the best. Anyways I knew it was possibly my thyroid so I basiclaly had to force the doctors to do a full panel. Everything was normal except my thyroglobulin which was 128 above reference range. I recently then changed my diet and am feeling great! Except my thyroid was abit swollen the other day but now its back to normal. I went back to my doctors to get T3 and T4 which was almost near impossible to convince as she said stress or a virus could just be causing it and its likely it will go down as in my antibodies, two doctors have told me this. So all my tests were normal, i feel normal. But I am worried? If i have an issue i want to go on meds but the doctor was saying its unlikely a specialist will see me, I have the right to see one i feel. Thoughts on whats going on? I have been super stressed and until recently i have relaxed after finishing uni I feel better, I am 24 Years old.\n",
      "Hello, I'm hoping someone can help me with some side effects I've been having from Tirosint (Levothyroxine in gel cap form for anyone who doesn't know). I've also posted this on another board in hopes to get some answers. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's a little over a year ago but just started meds about a month ago. For anyone curious, here's my last set of labs: 12/30/15 TSH 4.323 (.4-4.0) Free T3 2.81 (1.8-4.9) Free T4 1.07 (.65-1.74) I've been hesitant to begin medication because I am extremely sensitive to meds, but after having a severe chronic fatigue crash I decided to go to see how many of my symptoms were related to my thyroid. My doctor told me that Tirosint has a half life of 7 days, so I could start taking it infrequently to ease my body into it (I also only weigh 100 lbs if that's relevant to dosage and side effects). She recommended three times a week , but told me even once a week was ok to start due to the half life. I started with 13 mcg Tirosint every 5 days. Within a few days I started having severe physical anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are: -Severe physical(not mental) anxiety, like I'm on the verge of a panic attack/extremely nervous - feeling like my heart is beating out of my chest - mild loss of appetite The symptoms have been coming in attacks and then also existing on a milder level throughout the day. I have gone some days without the symptoms. I have now been on the medication for about a month . My doctor said the symptoms should not be from the Tirosint. However I am quite confident that the symptoms are from the Tirosint. I have experienced symptoms like these in the past , however they were much more infrequent and more mild. The only time I have experienced a similar feeling to this was trying to start Zoloft, Which is a very activating medication at first. I can endure the symptoms a little bit longer if I know they will eventually go away and as long as I know they are not serious, however considering my doctor does not believe they're related to the medication is concerning to me . Has anyone that has taken Tirosint, Synthroid or any other variation of Levothyroxine experienced similar side effects when beginning the medication? Were you eventually able to tolerate the medication without side effects? I'm barely even taking it at this point and I can't imagine upping my dose to get to a more normal dose. It seems crazy to me that I could swing to hyper after taking so little, but is it possible? I have had it suggested that O may be over medicated, in that My thyroid's not off enough to treat. My dr is treating based on stmptoms more than anything. Thank you so much for your help! Sorry for the long post .\n",
      "Okay, my son will be 4-years old in January, but is only 36\" tall and 24 pounds (the oldest in his pre-school and smallest). I was always small growing up, but am now 5'7\" and 120 pounds, so not small (I used to be around 105-110 before having kids). My husband is 5'10\" and 185 pounds (so pretty average in size I guess). My oldest son (6-years old) is on the smaller size as well, but more so in weight than height (he's 48\" and 42 pounds). So my point is that we aren't a big size family, but my 3-year olds pediatrician is concerned that he's small. So, she did a bunch of blood work on him (over a year ago and just last week). His test last week revealed a slightly elevated TSH of 7.43 (0.60 - 7.40 mU/L). A little over a year ago my son's TSH was 5.9 mU/L (the range was 0.60 - 7.40 mU/L). His pediatrician agreed that it'd be worth while to have an endocrinologist see him. The endocrinologist wasn't concerned and said that my son wouldn't be small if he had hypothyroidism. I'm wondering if that is accurate based on my own experience, my TSH was on the higher end being 3.9 (range 0.5 - 4.5). I am considered as having \"subclinical hypothyroidism\", I take 75 mcg of Synthroid and feel much better (my TSH is around 1.2 or so now). (My thyroid levels weren't discovered until my 30s.) I was always one of the smaller kids in class despite being one of the oldest kids in my grade. Also, I didn't start my period until I was almost 17 years old and stopped growing around 21 (so, late bloomer). I am left wondering if my thyroid wasn't working efficiently as a kid. However, most people associate hypo with being heavy. So, I'm also wondering if my son's TSH level should be concerning. Could his small size have anything to do with his TSH being on the higher side? I know that seems \"backwards\", but I too was always small and am slightly hypo. Also, is there any other level or condition that would cause a slightly high TSH?\n",
      "Hi I was wondering if anyone has successful stories when it comes to weightloss when being diagnosed with hypothyroidism. My TSH was 4.46 and my doctor put me on 25 mcg of levothyroxine. What were your levels along with the associated dosage of medication?\n",
      "Hello all, how are we? I am just wondering if anyone else has had this problem? My doctor is at a bit of a loss why all of a sudden my free T4 isn't rising (Hypothyroidism dx for about a decade now). I was also just diagnosed with Addison's disease so for the mean time we have up'd my meds another 25mcg to see if that gets it going while we sort out the Addison's. What I'm wondering is, what if it's still abnormally low? What could be causing it does anyone have experience? My doctor just told me not to worry for now, but I like to know what's going on with my body and I haven't quite understood reading other posts and google for what fits in with my situation. Thank you for your time! K.\n",
      "Hey, so I've recently found out I have a thyroid nodule. One thing also that I've been experiencing for a few years now is chronic sinus issues. I don't know if there is any connection between the nodule and the sinuses but maybe. If there is, what I'm thinking is the body could see the nodule as something foreign, in the same way it sees a virus or bacteria, and in turn the nodule could then activate the body's immune system, leading to chronic sinus issues etc. Maybe, I don't know. Just curious if anyone else is experiencing or has heard of anyone experiencing chronic sinus issues connected along with thryoid issues, especially nodules..\n",
      "Alright so a couple months ago an ultrasound found that I had a fluid filled nodule just to the outside of my right thryoid lobe. I was hoping to get it biopsied and went in to see a surgeon yesterday but he said that it was too small currently to biopsy. The dimensions of the nodule are 0.6cm X 0.36cm X 0.38cm. Which is smaller than a marble, but larger than a bb. In fact I used a ruler and drew a little cube out on paper of those dimensions and it looked like I could probably fit at least 3 bb's in such a space. Seems to me like surely a needle, even a larger gauge needle, let alone a smaller gauge, would have no trouble penetrating such a space and extracting out some cells. But apparently not according to the doctor I saw yesterday. I'm kind of thinking of looking for a second opinion from another surgeon, but then again they might just say the same thing. Any thoughts, experiences, or stories? Thanks\n",

      "Hello, I am a 21 year old female college student. About a month and a half ago, I noticed a large lump in my throat that moved up and down when I swallowed. Slightly concerned, I made an appointment at my university health center, where they drew blood and my thyroid levels came back normal (I have no hyper or hypothyroid symptoms anyway.) After visiting my primary doctor, I had an ultrasound done that showed a 2.5cm nodule on my isthmus (midline thyroid) with 2 tiny (mm sized) on either side which aren't palpable or visible and I didn't realize I had. The report also said there is increased vascularity, or blood flow, to the area which my endo said could be cancerous or it could just be because the nodule is large with extra blood flow to the area. I have my biopsy scheduled for next week to determine what type of nodule the 2.5 cm one is (benign or malignant.) To be honest, I'm scared of the results. I have always been healthy other than the occasional common cold, so this is something that really took me by surprise. For those who are going through or have gone through this, what was your experience with the fine needle biopsy like? If your nodule was benign, did you still get it removed just in case? I just turned 21 with a lot of life plans ahead of me and I am scared that due to its increased size, it could be cancer. Any and all advice or experience sharing is so greatly appreciated. Thank you, N\n",
      "Hello, everyone - This is my first post. I was diagnosed with suboptimal/subclinical hypothyroid back in the fall of 2014. My first labs before treatment were: TSH 1.5 (range 0.4 - 4.5) Free T4 of 1.2 (range 0.8-1.8) Free T3 of 2.9 (range 2.3 - 4.2) Question #1 : Is this truly suboptimal thyroid? I am beginning to question going on treatment given that it is 2 years later and my labs are not that much better (see below). Current labs with 75 mg. Synthroid and 20 mcg Cytomel TSH .04 (range 0.4 - 4.5) LOWER than my initial labs with NO meds Free T-4 .09 (range .08-1.8) LOWER than my initial labs with NO meds Free T-3 2.9 (range 2.3 - 4.2) Same as my initial labs WITH 20 mcg. Cytomel Question 2: I had been feeling well and had symptom relieve with 75 mg. Synthoid and 20 mcg. Cytomel for almost a year, and out of the blue, I started getting symptoms of hypo again last month, and are still going on (total of about six weeks). WHY out of the blue on the same dosage would symptoms come back? Nothing else has changed! Question 3: My doctor said when I asked about increasing dosage was that the .04 was already super low and she would NOT up my dosage. Doesn't the T4 being low mean that it would make sense to increase the dose, even though the TSH is low? Also, WHY is my T4 decreasing to even less than it was without meds? Isn't this what the Synthroid is for - to INCREASE the T4 (which it didn't) and to DECREASE the TSH (which it did)? The pink question is the one that I can't wrap my mind around. I feel like I am no better off now than I was when I didn't take anything at all. Thoughts?? And thanks for entertaining my questions as part of my FIRST post! Dottie\n",

      "I am very new here and new to thyroid nodules. My 37 year old husband was diagnosed with a 4cm x 5cm single solid nodule without calcification today. This was from ultrasound. His blood work also came back as hyperthyroid. We have been referred For fna, but don't go for 10 days. I am the worrier and am just feeling sick about this. Anyone have any helpful information? It seems that because his thyroid was hyper along with the nodule that this is less likely to be cancer?? It's just so huge. He has no symptoms. Thank you!\n",
      "Hi everyone, Just wondering if anyone can give me a little bit of guidance regarding adding a bit of T3 to my T4-only medication. I have Hashimoto's, and am finding that T4-only medication just doesn't have me feeling well. I still have muscles aches, terrible insomnia, feel cold when other people aren't and my skin & hair feel & look like crap! I'm currently on Oroxine (Australian T4-only). My latest labs are: TSH: <0.05 (0.20 - 4.00) Free T4: 21 (15-30) Free T3: 5.1 (2.8 - 6.8) My doctor is telling me I'm over-medicated, however after all these years of not doing so well on T4-only I really want to add a little T3 to see if it helps. I have already sourced T3 over the internet (Tiromel) - doctors here in Australia don't prescribe T3 unless in extreme circumstances. If I add in, say 6.25mcg then 12.5mcg T3 after a couple of weeks, how much do you think should I reduce my T4 dose by (currently taking 125mcg)? Would really appreciated any replies and/or guidance. Thanks heaps in advance! :-) Tracie\n",

      "Hello, I stumbled across this board while looking for some answers yet again :-) I have hypothyroidism but I have been suffering servere fatigue, 40 kg weight gain in a very short amount of time I can't lose no matter what I do, total loss of libido amongst many many other things these past few years and have only recently been referred to an Endocrinologist. Seems my TSH and free T3 are normal, but my free T4 is low. TSH: 2.54 Range (0.50-4.00) Free T4: 8.5 Range (10.0-19.0) Free T3: 5.0 Range (3.5-6.5) My ferritin levels are also low, as is my cortisol and liver function was a tad on the low side. All immune disorders were negative. Ferritin: 10 Range (15-165) Transferrin Sat: 14 Range (13-47) 9am Cortisol: 132 Range (145-619) I am having the synacthen stimulation test in a couple weeks and they are also talking MRI to check my pituitary.

      "I have something I am very confused about. I have been hypothyroid and on only 50mcg of levothyroxine once daily. Lately as I am trying to lose weight, exercising and eating a clean diet I am gaining a ton of weight, and it's fat, not muscle. I have had dry itchy skin and eyes, fatigue but restless. I went in to get my thyroid rechecked the Dr only tested my free t4 and tsh as far as thyroid testing goes. My tsh is 1.5 which is good, and my free t4 is 0.8 which is low. She said that is a normal result when someone is on thyroid supplementation. Is that right? I'm confused also because I have been having these thyroid symptoms for years until I was finally diagnosed , but my tsh has never been above a 2. And the symptoms never really subsided even after starting supplementation. I thought it is usually higher when you have thyroid disease. My vitamin d is also low but I have been recently taking 50000 units vit d once a week to help. Thanks!\n",
      "3 weeks ago my TSH was 5.35. I've been on Levo 75 mcg for 18 days but am not any better but feel worse. Is there any chance my thyroid numbers could be getting worse. My airway feels like it is closing and sometimes it is just hard to breathe at night especially. We have a pulse ox here at the house and I put it in and my heart rate resting is in the lower 50's and noticed it going down to 48 a couple of times. I know I have only been on the med for less than 3 weeks but still maybe I need the labs rechecked? Would Armour take effect more quickly since it already has T3 in it?\n",
      "I just joined this site, because I was reading up on thyroid disorders and I have so many questions... I'm 21 years old, a female, and obese. I am 5 ft tall and weigh around 80 kilos and have been overweight since the age of 7. I've been stuck at 5 feet since 10. I got my period at age 14 and it was highly irregular to the point where I didn't menstruate for 2 whole years. My hormone tests always came back normal. But for the past year I've been suffering from insane bloating, acidity and constipation. I finally showed a doctor last month and he said to get a blood sugar test and a TSH test done. The blood sugar test came back healthy but the TSH was at 5.22 so the doctor said he wouldn't recommend treatment just yet, and said to take the TSH test again in 3 months. If the result came back as high as 10-12 only then to see him again. He's a gastroenterologist. He didn't suggest testing my T4 and T3 levels. Should I get them done? Can I get them done if my doctor doesn't tell me to? He just gave me pills and lifestyle advice for the constipation and bloating and it wasn't helping so all he said was to try 2 months instead of 3 before doing the TSH test again. Is he right? Or is 5.22 enough to be alarmed about given my symptoms and age? Even when I take the pills and have a healthy diet and workout, it doesn't work. A new pill or new dosage will improve conditions for the first week or so and then I go back to my previous state. I hate the bloating. It intervenes with weight loss. Makes me look like I have a baby bump. And no matter how hard I workout, my weight never decreases. Any insight will be highly appreciated, thanks!\n",
      "When I was trying to get pregnant, my TSH numbers are low but in the normal range. Because I was a high risk, my doctors put me on synthroid and Cytomel to be safe and because I was tired, achy, and depressed. I had a micarriage and have still been taking the mess for a year. My symptoms have not gotten better actually worse and I have gained 20 pounds in a year. Is there a way to wean off synthroid if my labs are normal?\n",
      "I've had hypothyroidism for 10 years. Last March the doctor lowered my dose of levothyroxin because of blood work results. I gained 27 pounds in five months and was extremely tired.

TSH .59 (.6 - 4.99) Free t4 15 (9-19) Free t3 3.5 (3.2-6.2) I have a nodule on my parathyroid as well. I am going to an endocrinologist for the first time. The weight has not come off since the meds were increased and I've started excercising every day and eating properly. I'm still exhausted as well. I'm worried they will lower my dosage again.

      "Hi all. I just had my TSH levels checked, and I'm sitting at 3.52, and although I know I'm not as high as a lot of you folks, I have been suffering with a ton of symptoms and I'm still fighting to have my free T3 and T4 levels checked. The lab my doctor uses, the 'normal' range for TSH is 5.0. I was able to find the Canadian Thyroid Association's suggestion of 0.3 - 3.5, but I haven't been able to find anything for the American Thyroid Association. I've read on a bunch of forums that it was recently changed to 0.3 - 3.0? I'd like direction to a notable organization so my doctor will be more inclined to listen to me. I'm at my wits end with this stuff. I know there's something wrong with me. While I can't be certain that I'm hypo, I can't be certain I'm not either until they runs the tests. I'm trying to arm myself with as much information I can so I'm taken seriously. Any feedback from people that had a TSH level similar to mine would be great too! Any help or information whatsoever would be huge help!! Edit: If anyone could tell me what the OPTIMAL levels for everything are, there seems to be a lot of discrepancies. Thanks\n",
      "I have been having some health issues for about 12 years, however the past 4 years have been the worst of my life. I have been struggling with always being tired, no energy, moody, weight gain, my Dr. Had been encouraging me to have lab work done, well about a month and a half ago, I finally agreed. Well my TSH was flagged as low, my calcium, potassium, chloride, and sodium were all high. My b-12 was low (as usual) I have been doing g the injections for a few years. My Doctor, suggested that by the result's she was leaning towards Hyperthyroidism, which makes sense, because my mom has it, and Greave's Diseases. However she was concerned because of the symptoms being more of Hypo, she referred me to and Endocrine which as of yet I haven't had an appointment yet, presently I had to go to the hospital for a different reason, and they did some CT scan's, and told me my thyroid gland was extremely inflamed, and I should have it checked as soon as possible. I explained I already had some labs done, and I was currently waiting on the specialist to contact me for an appointment. I'm not sure really what all this means, but I happen to stumble across this forum, and figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for some opinion's. I bounce between both symptom's, just more so the Hypo, then hyper. Just any advice to what could be going on, or what I should be more concerned with asking the Doctor when I do go. I have had a lot of stiffness in my knee's, neck, in between my shoulder blade's, and just really lost and confused on this whole thing.\n",

      "Hello everyone! I've been visiting the board often as I research thyroid issues. A bit about me. I'm a 47 year old female recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's in October of this year. I had suffered from iron anemia for years and went to the family doctor in June of this year because the pain in my hips/legs (that I had been experiencing for a few years now) had gotten progressively worse and was becoming debilitating. Anyhow, while there, I remembered I had not followed up on bloodwork from a couple of years ago when their office called me. He looked it up and it revealed my b12 was 84 (normal low end of range in Ontario starts at 120) and my ferritin was <5. Anything less than 20 is considered anemic. Anyhow, he gave me another requisition to get updated bloodwork to check on the anemia, cbc, potassium, sodium etc and unbenounced to check my TSH. Well my labs revealed I was still extremely anemic; B12 was now at 80 and ferritin was still <5. My TSH was 4.32, WBC were approaching HI. So he put me on b12/iron supplements and prescribed a low dose of Synthroid (.025 mcg). By the way, he diagnosed my hip/leg pain as IT band syndrome and referred me for physio. He also gave me a requisition to repeat the labs in 3 months, however (again unbenounced to me) he also ordered the TPO and Tgab antibodies be tested on that req. The Tgab came back at 414 and TPO came back >600 although my TSH was now down to 3.09. Sso his office called me to say they were calling the pharmacy to up my Synthroid dose to .050. I called them and said, fine but I'd like to have an appointment to discuss further and get questions answered. He hadn't even bothered to tell me what TSH even was up till now and only really stated my thyroid was underactive. Based on the fact that he ordered the antibodies on the second req tells me he had a haunch it might be Hashimoto's and he was right. As I educated myself, I went into the follow-up inquiring if he should at least examine my thyroid and perhaps send me for an ultrasound to which he basically felt by neck for all of 5 seconds and said \"yeah, it seems a bit swollen\". No lymph nodes checked or even a full thyroid exam. Regardless, he gave me the req for the Ultrasound and I go on November 9th. I should point out, I also noticed that I have skin discolouration or lack of pigment starting around the front of my ears and jawline on both sides. I asked him if it was vitiligo (yet another autoimmune disorder) and he said yes, it appears to be. I'm also have very brown skin (I'm of Irish decent and was always fair in my youth and have a lot of freckles), however, in recent years I seem to have a tan that just never goes away, even in the winter. I inquired with the doc, even though I know it's rare, if possibly I should be checked for Addison's to which he replied, well what symptoms do you have? I indicated my main symptoms overlap hypothyroidism (weak, lethargic, no energy, dizzy, lightheaded and brain fog) even after being on b12/iron and synthroid but these also go hand in hand with anemia. My main symptom that leads me to suspect some degree of adrenal insufficiency is the skin discolouration and this perpetual feeling of bing \"buzzed\" like when you're a bit tipsy from alcohol for instance. He dismissed that notion and said it's likely we just haven't found the optimum dosage for the hashi's. So, long story short, my questions are: 1) Does anyone else have coconcurring autoimmune disorders like hashi's and Addison's or adrenal insufficiency 2) Shouldn't he have at least checked my adrenal function (cortisol levels etc) before administering thyroid meds? 3) Isn't it reasonable to question if one's own immune system is attacking one gland, wouldn't it attack another? I should also mention, when I was talking to the doc on my followup visit after he up'd my synthroid dose, could I have had hypothyroid for years and just chalked it up to the anemia in error and he indicated, no I've always checked your TSH along with Anemia and it only now is coming back with high reading since 2014. But if I'm understanding all my research, the antibodies could have been there attacking my thyroid for years and it only now has gotten to \"beat up\" that is couldn't keep up with normal thyroid hormone production, hence triggering Pituitary to start producing TSH, am I correct about that? Sorry for the long-winded post. If you made it to the end, thanks for taking the time to read and I appreciate any thoughts/comments etc.\n",

Hair loss so bad I have thin patches on my scalp. I've been on anti depressants for over a year now, and on an HRT patch for menopause (I'm 45 yo and fully menopausal). Have had numerous TSH tests over the years as my mom, her sister and my grandma all have thyroid issues so I figured I was susceptible. Nope, all TSH results came back normal range every time. I've been on HRT and antidepressants for over a year now and I should be feeling better, right? Not.... Last week, I insisted on having my T3/T4 tested along with my TSH. My dr. balked and said they don't like to do it when TSH is within range. I insisted and stated my reasons and she finally agreed to do it, but I had to go to the hospital to have it done.

      "Hello all, my first post here :-) I am 49 years old, and had a mild heart attack back in March. Fortunately I had no blockage, no damage and I take only aspirin and a low BP medicine. However, since that time, I have not been feeling 'well'. Meaning, not functioning optimally and it's not my 'heart'. We did confirm that I am fully in menopause now, so I realize my symptoms could be related to that. I have had this mild depression, some anxiety, fog thinking, inability to focus well at work or stay on task, sluggish - lazy. I am a fitness fanatic in my 'real life'. I am a certified personal trainer for fun! However, my workouts are ineffective it seems, I am unable to lose the 'last 15 pounds'. I have hot flashes sporadically, or sometimes I am very cold. My skin does not look as healthy anymore. Sometimes at 3pm I could literally crash at my desk. My whole self seems 'slow' - like I just have no motivation or drive. We've tried a couple of antidepressants and they just don't work. (make me feel worse actually) I have heart thumps. Some anxiety here and there. I am normallyl a 'sharp', focused and driven person. I eat a low carb high fat (healthy fats) diet. I've been able to lower my A1C out of pre-diabetes ranges. I have mildly elevated cholesterol despite my healthy lifestyle. I have read that low Free T3 is a risk for cardiac issues. This makes me wonder if that is behind my out of the blue strange heart attack. I asked my primary doc to run thyroid panels, which she said came back 'normal'. I know in my research that my levels are 'sub-optimal' though. I have an appointment December 8th with endocrinology to evaluate further because 'something' just doesn't feel right with me. Here are my lab values- I would love a more experienced person's 'take' on them ... not a diagnosis obviously but a general idea of what I should have in my head for my appointment. TSH 1.340 uU/mL (0.400 - 5.500 uU/mL) **IN March after heart thing TSH was 3.6? Free T3 2.5 pg/mL (1.8 - 4.6 pg/mL) Normal but not optimal Free T4 1.1 ng/dL (0.7 - 1.8 ng/dL) Normal but not optimal Microsomal Antibody <1.0 IU/mL (<5.6 IU/mL) With my TSH fluctuating from normal high to normal low, and 'normal low' Frees, does it seem like my thyroid is sputtering out? Am I even looking in the right direction here to explain my symptoms? Thanks for any feedback you can give! I'm tired of feeling 'down' and lazy! Cyndi\n",

      "Hi, I am typically a very social, very active, very innately motivated person. I have hypothyroidism which has given me some sluggish symptoms in the past, but I take thyroid armour and levothyroxine (started one month ago) to deal with these symptoms. The drugs have helped my symptoms for the last four years, however my thyroid blood work almost always comes back low. I also have food allergies to eggs and dairy that have developed in the last two years. In July (2016), I started feeling very tired and with very little energy/motivation to do anything. It has steadily worsened since July. I was/still am drinking massive quantities of coffee to get through the day. For a few months, I was sleeping 16 hours a day, and now I have insomnia. What is happening to me? I look terrible. The circles under my eyes are extreme and my skin looks gray, even green sort of. My hair breaks extremely easily and does not grow. I haven't had a period in a year. I am 23 years old. I don't find joy in things that I usually love, I have trouble motivating myself to complete tasks, and I don't like being around people or going out as much as I did before... I am avoiding social situations. All of these seemed like signs of depression to me. So I saw a doctor who prescribed me 10mg Paxil. I started that four days ago, and I know I have to be patient with these meds to see any kind of results for the depression. But now, after researching adrenal fatigue and seeing that it sometimes comes with hypothyroidism more easily, etc., I wonder if I even have depression? Or is it just a symptom of the AF? I want to start taking some adrenal support supplements (I just bought Gaia). Is this supplement okay to take with Paxil? It has some mood boosting herbs and I want to give both options a shot, but need feedback. I have talked to my doctor and she is more of a pill pusher than a talker, I'm unhappy to say Has anyone had a similar to experience to this? Particularly anyone who has hypothyroidism? Thanks.\n",

He prescribed me 195mg of nature-throid to start out with. Which I had done research & knew this sounded extreme. So, I broke them into fourths. And started myself out slowly. I worked up to 1/2 the dose he prescribed. About a month ago, I started feeling really bad. Very jittery inside. My stomach has been hurting & just keeps getting worse. Its the kind of stomach ache that you get when you are nervous. It hardly ever goes away. I haven't been able to eat. Ive lost 10 lbs in one month. I can't concentrate. I've been crying almost every day about the silliest things. I stopped taking it 3 or 4 days ago. And im not sure if there are withdrawal symptoms. But all of this has been happening before I stopped taking it. Im just wondering if there is anyone else out there that has had this happen? I went to my gynecologist today to talk to her about my hormones and mentioned everything else going on. She felt my thyroid & told me my thyroid gland felt very skinny. And Im dehydrated from not being able to drink. Even drinking water or any liquid makes me feel sick. She said it wasn't bad enough to be admitted into the hospital for an IV. I just needed to drink more fluids. And, to rest & just take it easy until this med gets out of my system. It has been a very scary feeling. I have felt like I'm going crazy. Thanks for any input!!\n",
      "Hey guys.. can anyone explain the FT4 by Dialysis bloodwork? My endo suggested that it is a more accurate reading. Has anyone had it tested this way before? How were the results compared to standard FT4 testing? Thank you as always! j\n",
      "Hi all, My first post here. Last week I had a throat ultrasound done for some discomfort under my jaw, side of mouth/head, and found a thyroud nodule. Solid , hypoechoic, 0.9 cmX0.6cm X0.5 cm Poorly difined posterior border Presence of microcalcifications. Getting an FNA done soon. Has anyone got a benign result with these US results?

      "Hi, I am 36 and thyroid issues are all new to me, I feel very confused & worried. My ob/gyn did a free t4 and tsh test as part of an infertility workup. I have been experiencing secondary infertility, we had a miscarriage in March 2015 and have not been able tp concieve again. The tests my ob did showed a normal t4 amd a tsh of < 0.1. I had my appointment with the endocrinologist i was referred to today. He was ok, laughed a few times, but definetly not a warm n fuzzy guy. I do think he's very smart and definetly a strait shooter, not sure how I like that. I am now terrified. He said with that low of a tsh, my t4 and or t3 should be high. My t4 is the middle of normal. t3 had not been tested, he said it's possible just the t3 is high. He said based on the t4, if it was just one tsh showing low, he'd think it was a lab mistake, however since I've had 2 very low tsh readings 3 weeks apart, he does believe the tsh labs are accurate. I asked if any of the meds or imaging tests from my kidney stone admissions ( I had 3 hospital admission from August 1st through mid Sep) could be causing this, he verified when the admissions were and said the imaging studies would not cause it, he said high doses opoids could, but since it's now been more than a month since my last admission, and the tsh tests were 3 weeks apart, if it were from the opoids we should have seen an increase instead of decrease in the tsh. The tsh was <0.1, then 3 weeks later was 0.008, the t4 was only measured on the first labs and was 0.93. He's redoing the tsh, t4, running a t3, and testing for Graves, because he said Graves is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. My thyroid is slightly enlarged. If these tests do not come back with a clear answer as to why my tsh is so incredibly low, then we have to do an MRI to check for a pituitary gland tumor. 😐😕 MY basic labs will be back tomorrow, the test for Graves will not be back until next Tuesday and he said he will call me Wed. If it's hyperthyroidism we cannot continue trying to get pregnant toll it's fixed, as he said the meds aren't safe in pregnancy. I have lots of symptoms of graves or the pituitary tumor, the symptoms are almost identical. I have weight gain and extreme tiredness, which I know don't match up perfectly with hyper. I also have very thinning hair, cycles gwt shorter amd shorted down to 2r to 25 days amd bery light, vety hungry, anxiety, extreme hot sweats, diahreahha, my hands are shakey......I would love to hear if any of you have experience with this. I want to cry, I am so over health issues and being worried. I am now more worried than ever and feel like I have an elephant on my chest.\n",
      "Hello everyone, I want thank you all for being so knowledgeable, supportive and helpful. I'm a 37 year old mom, diagnosed with Hashi's six months post partum at the age of 34. Was put on levothyroxine, suffered through that (anxiety/ no appetite/ insomnia, etc.) for about a year. Finally talked to my PCP who agreed to let me try Armour. What a world of difference. Any way, what brings me to post - I have had a goiter for two or so years; one that is prominent enough for people to see it, and mention it. (Gee, thanks!) I also have a hard nodule on the left side of my thyroid for 10-15 years. It has grown in the past 2 years. My PCP does not seem concerned, I can't seem to get into my endo for 5 more weeks. What would you do in this case? I have reviewed many medical journals which say when Hurthle cells are found, the only way to determine if it's cancer is to do a partial or TT; and I've also read that Hurthle cells often show in Hashi's. What worries me most about these results is the \"predominantly\". Am I having too much health anxiety? Here is US from 6/19/16 US FINDINGS: The right lobe of the thyroid gland measures 4.0 x 2.1 x 1.8 cm in size. Overall, thyroid echotexture is heterogeneous. No discrete nodule is seen. Vascularity is increased. The left lobe of the thyroid gland measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.9 cm in size. There is a well-circumscribed hyperechoic nodule at the midpole posteriorly measuring 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.9 cm in size. This demonstrates peripheral vascular flow. The remainder of the gland is heterogeneous with increased vascular flow. The isthmus is thickened at 0.7 cm. It demonstrates heterogeneous echotexture and increased vascularity. PCP sent me for an FNA after receiving those results. Final Diagnosis of FNA: Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (FLUS); numerous background polymorphous lymphocytes with some colloid and follicular cells present predominantly as Hurthle cells with focal atypia; findings are favored to represent changes seen in the context of Hashimoto's thyroiditis\n",
      "Hello I had my thyroid tested recently, the doctor called me and said my T3 uptake is low and prescribed Synthroid. I'm having trouble understanding my test results, all seem to be in the normal range except for the T3 uptake. My symptoms include bloating, constipation, fatigue, and weight loss. I don't understand my results and I don't go back to the doctor for another 2 months. Any insight into my test results is appreciated! Do they indicate hypo or hyperthyroidism?

      "About 5-6 months ago I noticed I was very fatigued and weak all the time. I couldn't get up early anymore without having to drag myself out of bed. I felt (and still do) like a zombie. I noticed the increasing weakness. Even walking up some stairs and I felt winded! Not sure if all of these are the common symptoms but I also have hair loss, cold intolerance especially in my hands and feet, brain fog, constipation, skin is always dry, skipping months on my menstrual cycle, tenderness, horrible sleep patterns, irritability, and just overall not feeling myself and completely out of it 24/7! I have been so tired and weak that I see stars sometimes and have to sit down because I feel like passing out. I had blood work done for thyroid, adrenal fatigue, and a bunch of other things and everything has come back negative. I was sent to a neuropathologist because i had no reflexes in either of my legs. I had an MRI done on my brain and cervical. Brain was fine and cervical has some \"muscle spasms\" but nothing too serious I guess. Today I went for the results and I was asked about antidepressants! I am not depressed, and I am not crazy. I don't need a psychologist. The doctor also mentioned it probably stemming from my sleep issues. I don't know. My grandma has hypothyroidism. I am an 18 year old female who wants to enjoy my life again! If there's anyone who has gone or is going through this please let me know. If you think you know what this could be lmk asap! Thank you very much!\n",
      "Hi Everyone , I came back to the this web side after many years. I have been on thyroid medicine since 2006 , initially started with T4 medicine continue have symptoms like muscles weakness, brain fog , weight gain and lack motivation /exercise intolerance. 2009 doctor started cytomel 10mcg with 112mcg of synthyroid after RT3 test , it came out my RT3 was high and ratio between FT3/RT3 was low . I started feel bit better but continue have symptoms better but not resolved at all. Still can't do yard work , lot aches and pain most of the symptoms that bothers me a lot are muscles aches and pain and low sex drive . One point i came to the point i have to live that way whole life so stayed in that dose for last 5 years . Last month i was traveling from CA to Texas , i met with a guy who had similar symptoms like me but now he has no symptoms and enjoying his life . He refer me to to vitality clinic in dallas . I went there and he did like 35 plus test including RT3, iron , Testosterone and some virus test. He believe all my symptoms are RT3 ones and believe my treatment has been wrong . He stopped my T3 completely and gave me compounded 62.5 MCg of T3 , after 1 week i felt horrible it turn out all my symptoms back plus worst . I went back to him , he said you are probably too much on T3 but still will not add T4 in my treatment . He reduced my T3 dose 20mcg in the morning and 10 mcg at 2 pm . He said be in that dose for 10 days and them bump up 10mcg in the afternoon , gradually increase after 10 days 10 mcg , cut back if am having symptoms and blood pressure high, high palpitation , he also started HCG injection 1000IU twice a week and clomid 50mg /day . Iron 65mg /day , B12 5000IU /day , Vitamin D3 10000IU /day , DGEA 25mg /day and Prelongone 100mg /day . I must say after 10 days i started to feel less pain in my muscles , i am able to write about a page without having pain in my finger and muscles , i can't write before , less aches and pain. Still have symptoms but i believe that would go away once my dose is optimized . I like to share detail with everyone to let them know don't give up like me . I suffered a lot , there is a treatment out there it is just that not enough doctor go with non convential treatment . My question to you all who have been on T3 alone medicine . Have you ever go back to T4 medincine even RT3 clear up from your system ? How long usually take for you to clear up all the symptoms ? What is the amount of T3 dose should be taking ?, is there any calculation per your weight ?. I have read in a day you produce 30 mcg of T3 . Any body has similar story please share and discuss , so we can all go to new life. Trust me doctors are clueless , not all but majority . They can't think beyond their small head .\n",

      "I recently got my TSH tested, after having a variety symptoms, and it was high (around 5.0). One of the worst symptoms, besides the fatigue, is the numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. It is becoming painful at work since I do a lot of typing. However, instead of treatment, my doctor wants to retest in 6 weeks. Why is this? Why not just start treatment right away. My father has hypothyroidism, so it runs in the family. Also, I am only 25 years old and have a feeling I've been having some of the symptoms for awhile such as the fatigue. Thanks for your help!\n",
      "I just found this message board, and I really need some help. About a year ago I developed low body temperatures. Sometimes in the 94 -95 range. I work with trying to manage these low body temps every day. An ER doctor said it was thyroid problem and suggested I see an endocrinologist. I saw two. Neither could help me. I took a battery of tests: cat, MRI, cortisol, ACTH stimulation, cortisol saliva, infectious disease work up, heavy metal profile, and tons of blood work ups. My T4 was 1.27 and the T3 3.20. The endocrinologists said I had the classic symptoms of thyroid but could not understand the negative test results. Meanwhile, my skin is dry, I am cold all the time, my body temps drop in mid afternoon, my hair is thin and I have gained weight, while dropping most carbs. On my last visit to this Dr, he said perhaps the pituitary might not be feeding the thyroid. He told me since he has little knowledge of hypothermia endogenous, I would have to seek out someone who is knowledgeable in the area of hypothermia. I have been on the phone for days calling universities and major hospitals for a referral. I feel like I am at a huge road block. Can anyone help me? How can I locate a such a doctor? I a in Pennsylvania, and can travel to New Jersey, New York or surrounding areas. Your assistance is much appreciated.\n",
      "Do you think i have a deranged hyperthyroid if my t4 levels are 1.8 and tsh level is 0.01 and my thyroid peroxidase antibody is 3.0. My doctor told me I do.

      "Recently I went for a physical. I haven't been feeling great. Always cold, hair is shedding like crazy, bowel problems, headaches all the time really messed up long cycles. Charting bbt and I only ovulate maybe once every 4 months. We've been trying to ttc for about 8 months with no luck(barely ovulate) I asked my NP to test my Thyroid as well as just a regular work up. TSH - 3.260 (0.300-4.500) T3 - 126 (90 - 178) Free T4 - 0.79 (0.60-1.60) She concluded that thyroid levels were normal. I begged to differ. I though they seemed off and maybe the reason we haven't been able to concieve. I then asked for an antibody test which she agreed to do for me. She also offered to refer me to an Endo if I wanted. She said that she wasn't comfortable prescribing meds and there are many Schools of though on what \"normal\" thyroid levels are. Endo appointment isn't for 3.5 months Anti Thyroid Peroxidase Abs - 186 (0-34) The other labs that she is more concerned about are my billirubin Total Bilirubin - 2.3 (0.3-1.0) Direct Bilirubin - 0.5 (0.0-0.2) She wants to send me for an ultrasound of my upper right quadrant next week. Since I can't get into another Doctor for months I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. Any thought on my numbers? I'm thinking of going Gluten Free to see if I can help myself a bit in the meantime. I already eat pretty healthy and exercise regularly.\n",
      "There is some history to this story, but hopefully, I can get some insight just asking one question! With regard to being possibly hypo, with a TSH of 5 and a normal Ft4 of 1.14, and a previous test with a TSH above 4 and FT4 1.4 with FT3 2.3 (this is from memory but pretty close), the endo I saw says that the FT4 etc is normal and that the elevated TSH is just from menopause, due to elevated FSH. He said treat the menopause and see where we are. I was in the midst of doing this, with Estriol vag cream - which I believed made me more hypo feeling - lost hair, etc - which I stopped and started to feel a bit better. However, the elevated TSH started before this. ANyway, I could find no evidence of this alleged truism related to menopause that the elevated FSH causes elevated TSH with no affect on the T4 and T3.\n",
      "Hello everybody, I'm new to these boards and although I don't have any (as of yet) diagnosed thyroid problem, I just wanted to run my readings by you guys to see what you think. My doctor ran a complete bloodwork on me, and due to chronic symptoms I have (digestive distress, fatigue, muscle weakness, unrefreshing sleep), and intestinal disorders being ruled out after my colonoscopy, my doctor ran the full blood panel while ALSO adding the Free T3 and the Free T4. Two days ago I just received my results online. Basically, my Free T3 was flagged as being too high. Here are my thyroid results: TSH: 1.73 Free T4: 17 Free T3: 6.0 Now, I have an appointment to see my doctor for follow up in two weeks about this. What can cause the T3 to be this high if the TSH is in the normal range? Does this point to anything significant or is it a non-issue? Any other tests I should ask for? Thank you!\n",
      "Hi all, I am very new to the subject of thyroid issues. I'm 31. I've gained 40lbs (which is a lot for me since I used to be 100-105) since December last year without any change in diet or routine. While discussing with my OB at my regular appointment, she checked my thyroid. She said it was enlarged and that I had a goiter (I think she mentioned nodules, too). Per her recommendation, I set up an appointment with an endo for next week. OB did blood tests while I was there. My thyroid level was 2.828 and I was told this is within the normal range. From what I've been reading, thyroid issues can be complicated to diagnose. But I would like to put this out there and see if anyone else had a similar experience. After looking around online, it seemed like my symptoms pointed to hypothyroid (fatigue, cold, dry skin/eyes, weight gain, depression, etc). But then my blood test was normal, so I'm at a loss. For what it's worth, I was on an antidepressant from December last year up until about 3-4 months ago when I stopped taking it because I thought it was to blame for the weight gain. I also switched to a lower dose birth control pill. I'm still gaining since those changes. Also, out of curiosity, I looked up my blood test results from just under a year ago. The TSH was 1.4. I'm not sure what's considered a normal increase, but it seemed significant. Anyone with input or similar experience? Thanks!\n",

      "I have been diagnosed with hypothyroid for almost 6 years and finally found a doctor who agreed to take me off the synthetic thyroid hormones. I have been on Westhryoid for a year now. Slight improvement, but because of hypercotisolism the doctor decided to pull me off of most of the thyroid medication. I am now only on 32.5 mg 1 x day. It's been 9 weeks. I had been 130 mg a day to begin with! It caused my heat to beat out of chest and raised my anxiety level until I felt like I was going crazy. My holist Dr. immediately suggested I go to down to 65 mg, but then I began to now run a higher bp than I had ever before on a pretty regular basis 140/80. Next, I was diagnosed with hyprcortisolism and as of just this past week, my cortisol remain remains off-the-charts high. I've been dealing with this for two years, switching doctors after a year, trying to get answers. With my current doc, I am down to 32.5 mg. 1x per dayl. Over the past two weeks I have developed charlie horses in the back of my lower legs and into my feet when I go to sleep at night. I wake up in real pain. I also have developed a random racing heart situation that comes and goes with no rhyme or reason. I am trying to figure out what really came first and what the connection is between my organs? Do I have a heart situation whereby my \"heart beat regulator\" is broke? And if so, has this caused my cortisol levels to rise ridiculously high, leading to high blood pressure (random) and has this caused damage to my liver and kidneys now? I just had an ultrasound done because I have a dull ache where my liver is (lower left quandrant of my rib cage in front). No results back yet, but I am trying not to be anxious--got to get that cortisol down! So now I am mainly concerned about the immediate dangers: high blood pressure (racing heart of 190/95 with pulse rates at various times of 110, 106, 101, etc.) and possible liver disease. Anyone have similar health issues? I don't know what else to do and where else to go? Thank you for any leads or further direction.\n",
      "Hi there. I will try to keep this brief! I'm a 40yo female. History of being hypo with Hasimotos. I'd been on 175mcg of synthroid and 2 cytomel daily for a long time. At my last endo visit my dr said it was ok for me to be a little \"over medicated\" because I was feeling great and finally able to lose some weight. That was about 6 mo ago. At some point during that time we reduced my synthroid dose to 150 and cut out a cytomel because I was feeling jittery. I've managed to lose 22 lbs and I'm still on the 150 mcg and now I have a problem. I've been losing hair like crazy. Some of it has broken off but most is falling out. It's getting noticeably thin and I'm starting to panic. I had bloodwork done on Monday for an appt I have next week but I'm literally in a panic over this. I feel like soon I'll have no hair left. Is it likely that I'm taking too much Synthroid and that's what's causing this? I don't know what to do or how to stop this!! Help!!\n",
      "Hello! I am fairly new to the thyroid world and am in need of some advice/guidance. Background: Average resting HR was around 77. I am female and 26. On July 5th 2015 (Sunday) I was sitting in a Starbucks not feeling right. I checked my HR on my phone app - it was in the 110s. I was half convinced I was having a heart attack. HR wouldn't go lower than 110. Went home and made an appointment with my PCP for the next day. On the 6th went in to see my PCP she said her first guess was my thyroid so she ordered a CBC/other blood tests. TSH 0.54 (0.4-4.5) FT4 1.1 (0.8-1.8) T3 Uptake 20 (22-35) My PCP recommended eating more iodine for the low T3 and put me on propranolol for the tachycardia for a month. Palpitations started and I went back - told it was a side effect of propranolol, extended my time on it another month. It helped get my HR back to the 70s. Got dizzy/weird feeling at work about 6 weeks later - told to stop the propranolol cold. Did not feel right all night/next day. My arm had minty tingle feeling. Went to the ER and they said my heart was fine but did another CBC/other blood tests. TSH 0.17 (0.36-3.74). I stopped the propranolol and my HR stayed okay for awhile. Then it started a weird cycle. I would wake up with my HR in the 60s. By lunch, I'd be in the 90s. By the time I got home from work, I'd be in the high 90s/low 100s. By the time for bed, it'd start going down to normal. It did this for a month or two. In September I got a facial (a present from a friend whose wedding I was in) where they asked if I had thyroid problems. I said I wasn't sure so they said they wouldn't use something to be safe. When I left the spa, my HR was 140. I sat down and it went to 120. On the way home, my friend's tire ripped and a tow truck had to be called. In the tow truck my HR was 150. Got back to my husband to go home and about four hours after noticing the rapid increase it started to go down. My PCP said it was likely an allergic reaction to the facial. Heart rate evened out in October - until my friend's wedding. HR was at 120 almost the whole day, but quickly dropped after I got to my hotel room that night. That was the last real bout of tachycardia that I have noticed. The rest of October, November, and most of December went without any incidents. Then on December 26th, I am doing my normal getting ready routine, at my parent's house as we were home for the holidays, and when I applied one of my moisturizers, I encountered a lump on the right side of my neck. It felt like there was a soft golfball under my skin, that I am still 95% sure wasn't there the day before. In panic mode I Googled and came across the three most likely suspects - swollen lymph node, thyroid cancer, or a goiter. It was a Saturday and I was 150+ miles from my PCP so I went to the urgent care center where I was. The practitioner said it didn't feel like my thyroid or a lymph node but she drew blood to check my TSH and T4. TSH 0.09 (0.4-4.5) FT4 1.1 (0.8-1.8) I set up an appointment for the first day I could with my PCP and waited. She felt the lump and recommended an ultrasound. Got it the next week. Here is the summary of my ultrasound from 1/12/16. \"Indication: Lump in throat, lump in right side throat since 26 December 2015 Comparison: None Findings:The right thyroid lobe measured 4.7 x 3.1 x 2.9 cm. The left thyroid lobe measures 3.7 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm. Large cystic focus with intraluminal debris and septations occupying the right thyroid lobe measuring 3.6 x 2.6 x 2.7 cm. No vascular flow. Within the right aspect of the thyroid isthmus a small hypoechoic nodule was identified measuring 6 x 9 x 6 mm. Within the left aspect of thyroid isthmus a 1.6x 0.8 x 1.6 cm solid nodule is identified. It is slightly hypoechoic. No abnormality identified in the left thyroid lobe Impression: 1. 3.6 x 2.6 x 2.7 cm complex cystic structure with septations in intraluminal debris within the right thyroid lobe 2. 2 solid nodules the thyroid isthmus. The larger of the 2 nodules measures 1.6 x 0.8 x 1.6 cm. Consider FNA of this larger solid nodule .. Otherwise recommend ultrasound follow-up in 6 months.\" PCP then referred me to and Endocrinologist. Took 4 months to get in to see him. Saw the Endo in April - diagnosed hyperthyroidism based on previous symptoms and bloodwork and ordered TSH, T4 and Thyroglobulin tests. TSH 0.57 (0.4-4.5) FT4 1.1 (0.8-1.8) Thyroglobulin Antibodies <1 (<or = 1) Thyroglobulin 98.5 (2.8-40.9) He also ordered a biopsy and thyroid uptake and scan. Waited a month for the uptake and scan. Waited two months for the biopsy. Biopsy came back benign. Here are the results of the scan: \"Indication: Suspected or known hyperthyroidism. No thyroid sonogram is presently available. Reportedly a sonogram on 1/12/16, apparently done elsewhere, revealed a 3.6 cm complex nodule on the right lobe, and two nodules on the isthmus. A TSH on 4/11/16 was normal at 0.57 (0.3-4.0 uIU/mL).\" \"Radeioactive Ioding Uptake 24 hour uptake = 30% (normal 10 to 35)\" \"Technetium Scan There is quite a heterogeneous isotope distribution throughout both lobes. There is a spheroid area of relatively intense isotope distribution in the lower portion of the right lobe and another in the upper portion of the left lobe.\" \"Impression: In the context of confirmed hyperthyroidism, the radioisotope uptake value and the radioisotope scan findings together would be consistent with one of the heterogeneous, non-suppressed forms of hyperthyroidism, most likely either toxic nodular thyroid or two toxic adenomas. Unfortunately the previous sonogram images are not presently available for comparison.\" Endocrinologist declared it a toxic multinodular goiter and said I had three options - control with medication, RAI, or TT. I opted for TT. Met with a surgeron in June and scheduled the TT for Mid-October. Back to now: I haven't had any symptoms (that I can tell) since last October, almost a year ago. I feel fine. I had my PCP run the following tests last week: TSH - 0.72 (0.4-4.5) FT4 - 1.0 (0.8-1.8) T3 Uptake - 21 (22-35%) TSI - <89 (<140% baseline) TPO (Antibodies) - 1 (<9) TBII - 14 (< or = 16%) To me, those results do now show me being hyper. My current resting HR is in the 60s, sometimes even in the 50s. Once out of the Dr's office, surgery seems like such a drastic measure when I have felt fine and have no symptoms other than a lump on my thyroid. I have read horror stories about people that have a TT and then go on to gain massive amounts of weight and as someone who is already obese, I do not want to add to that. I have actually been losing weight the last three months (through diet and exercise). I have a friend that was hyper in 2012 and has since gained 60lbs after RAI. I don't want that to be me if it isn't necesary. Guidance and advice, especially from anyone with experience with nodules, toxic or otherwise, would be appreciated. I am just so confused with what to do.\n",
      "Friend of mine has recently diagnosed Hypothyroidism, treatment started and his thyroid hormone (TSH) level became normal. Does Hypothyroidism cause fatigue even if he has normal Thyroid levels?\n",

      "I have been having hypo symptoms for over a year, however my doctor says everything is normal and said my stress level is causing my symptoms and put me back on antidepressants. I had an ultrasound done and it was discovered that I had several small nodules on the left lobe and a 3 cm on the right lobe. I had a Biopsy done a month later which came back benign. I have all the classic symptoms, fatigue, weight gain, inability to lose weight no matter what I do, pain in my joints and feet, dry skin, brittle dry hair etc. I can't see the antidepressants helping these symptoms....so far it's been 3 weeks and no improvements. Doctor said give it 6-8 weeks and call him back if I don't feel any better. I feel he is going to keep telling me everything is normal when I clearly don't feel right....I get the feeling he thinks it's all in my head. Anyway here are my lab results.

      "I have been taking 50mg synthroid for 6 weeks(first times on any thyroid meds) and just had blood levels done- Tsh-0.85 (0.40-4.50) Ft4- 1.0 (0.8-1.8) Ft3- 1.90 (2.30-4.20) Before starting synthroid my ft3 was 2.28 and ft4 was 0.8 My diagnosis is central hypothyroidism, so my actual thyroid is ok (so tsh means almost nothing in regards to dosing) it is a dysfunction in the feedback loop. My endocrinologist said first we will raise synthroid to 75mg then if I am still not feeling better in 6 weeks (regardless of what blood results are) we will either add t3 med or armour or another med containing both t4 and 3. I haven't felt any better on the 50 mg and don't have much hope for the 75. I have weight gain despite eating well and working out and hair is coming out in clumps. I am tired- feel like I am barely getting thru day. If after 6 weeks I do not feel better, should I push for adding a t3 or changing meds all together?

      "Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism back in 2013. .75mg of Synthroid was working great. This summer I started to experience a lot of symptoms--honestly manic in nature but more towards hyperthyroid symptoms (hot, hair falling out, anxious, tired, eye twitch, sore, etc. etc.) I am a vegan ultramarathon runner (Just an FYI). Got to the dr and did some bloodwork on 9/4/2016 . It showed: Reverse T3 is 25.7 (H) (9.2-24.1) Thyroglobulin Antibody is 0.0 (0.0-0.9) TPOAb is 33 (High in range) (0-34) T4, Free (Direct) is 1.86 (H) (0.82-1.77) Thyroid Stim Immunoglobulin is 55 TSH is 1.16 (0.450-4.5) Ferritin, Serum 21 (15-150) Iron Bind.Cap.(TIBC) 365 (250-450) UIBC 271 (131-425) Iron, Serum 94 (27-159) Iron Saturation 26 (15-55) They claimed this was 'high normal' but I said I didn't think so...I had requested FT3 at the time and I was told no. I requested it again and they did TT3 by mistake (awesome). So more bloodwork on 9/16 showed: Triiodothyronine (T3) 112 (71-180) Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy 42.1 (30.0-100.0) ...Tested negative for Epstein Barr, other vitamins I did were decent. I again requested FT3, and finally got it. On 9/26/2016 my results: FT3 2.9 (2.0-4.4) My dr's rec was that I had gone slightly hyperthyroid so we lowered my Synthroid from .75mg to .625mg--I have been on this for a week now. My concern is that based on my results I'm not converting to FT3 well. My dr disagrees. She is willing to prescribe a low dose of cytomel, but thinks it will make me hyperthryoid. My questions are: 1) Do I just need to start over with labs all from the same day? I also took synthroid the morning of all three labs. 2) Do I take the Cytomel prescription even though dr thinks it is unnecessary? Any help would be much appreciated as I'm pretty fed up but also very nervous to start playing around with medicines. It should be noted that my dr also did not catch that my ferritin and Vitamin D were very low as they were 'in range'. I have started taking supplements since then, and they are: --Iron --Vitamin D --B-12 --Vitamin E --Selenium --Evening Primrose Oil Okay--let me know what other information would be helpful! And let me know what thoughts you have...\n",
      "So, I'm sure there are plenty of these stories here, I've read a few across the web. My sweet wife is just done. She's so tired after 10 years of trying to figure out what is wrong with her. A hundred special diets and tests and even antidepressants, and nothing has ever helped. Please please please help me figure this out. We just finally did a full panel of Thyroid tests with TrueHealthLabs online after years of the typical TSH test that has been normal. My wife (her name is Megan) has just about every hypothyroid symptom. We were fortunate to hear from lots of people online about the failures of TSH tests alone and were so excited to hear stories that sounded just like hers. So we ordered the tests and were anxiously awaiting the results excited that she might finally know what's wrong and possibly have a course of action. I received the results via email today and I can't bare to tell her that seemingly all the results are normal. Not again! Honestly I don't think she's going to take it well, and I can't break her heart. So I'm here imploring this community to help me figure this out. Below are the symptoms and the test results. Thank you in advance for your help. Symptoms: First off this all started after my wife gave birth to our 3rd child. We now have 4 but the last one (who is actually now our oldest) is adopted because of how difficult pregnancies were on her - super heavy and lengthy periods, sometimes with heavy clotting and for most of the 10 years she's had these symptoms, she has also had really depression prone pms often for 10 days prior to her period. - major aches and pains all over her body but especially in her legs. Often this is heightened by gluten so she is now gluten free but still has the pains, plus often swelling in the legs and ankles - lots of headaches (she's basically in pain all the time) - she finds it very hard to lose weight even when eating very little. She has gone through times where she's probably only consuming 1,000 calories a day or less and is still gaining weight - she wakes up tired, lives all day tired and goes to bed really tired. 10 hours of sleep and she still wakes up feeling exhausted - she hasn't gone to the bathroom in 10 years... Ok maybe an exaggeration, but not by much. She maybe can go (bm) once every 7-10 days... Laxatives don't even seem to help much anymore - she's pretty much always cold... I know this is a symptom, but that's pretty much been as long as I've known here (20yrs) - I'd say she really only has 7 days a month, if that, where she isn't depressed to some degree, depending on the month, it can be slightly lighter or more heavy depression - not sure if this helps, but she has also always been a bit iron deficient, she was anemic during her pregnancies, and she very easily bruises I'm sure there are more but those are the ones that come to mind Thyroid battery of testing results: T3 uptake: 32 T4 Thyroxine: 7.2 Free T4 (T7): 2.3 TSH: .87 T4 free: 1.1 T3 free: 2.8 T3 Total: 82 T3 Reverse LC/MS/MS: 23 Thyroglobulin Antibodies: <1 Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies: 1 Ok that's it. I'm praying someone out there can help me make sense of this... I just want my girl to finally feel better\n",
      "I'm a 19 year old female who has had an enlarged thyroid on-and-off for as long as I can remember. My mom, who has Hashimoto's, always brushed it off as asthma since my only apparent symptom was feeling a tightness/large lump in my throat, difficulty swallowing pills, & trouble breathing at night- I was never treated for anything though. Every doctor I've ever seen has wanted my TSH tested once they felt my thyroid, but they always say the tests are normal. I just recently had electrolytes, free T3 & T4 done but those came back normal too. I never thought that my chronic throat tightness could be my thyroid until like a week ago. I'm too embarrassed to kick up a fuss about this even though it's become really uncomfortable these past few days- I don't sleep well because I feel like I'm being strangled, and I don't breathe well in general. It usually gets better after a couple of days, which is why I don't want to make an appointment everyone is going to end up telling me was useless/unnecessary because there's nothing wrong with me. Any other signs that I have of Hashimoto's have always been chalked up to diet (which admittedly is not good)- chronic depression, fatigue, and \"brain fog\" are the big ones. Am I missing a blood test that I need? Is there any chance I could get some relief for my enlarged thyroid?\n",
      "Hi all, I found this site while trying to find answers for my many symptoms I've been experiencing, i feel as though my symptoms have taken over my life and I almost feel trapped inside myself. A little background, im 25 I have a 2+ yr old looking back now i believe my symptoms started around that time but possibly before, i was suffering extreme depression and anxiety before i became pregnant, i was prescribed paxil and immediately stopped when i found out i was pregnant. Fast fwd to after his birth, i didnt feel depressed or anxiois but i felt similar symptoms as i do now but i chalked it all up to me being tired and hormonal from having a baby. . . However, now 2 years later i feel extremely and i mean debilitatingly exhausted, even after a full 8+ hrs i wake up and literally will sit down and fall back asleep, i have NO energy to play with my son, complete housework, even simple things as dishes and laundry and picking up toys. I just want to sleep. Its so sad and unfair. I am normally am a quick thinker and well versed, however i now cant think clearly, i feel foggy and its as if i cant speak clearly or lose my train of thought while speaking or telling stories its embarrassing. My attention span is gone, i cant focus and complete simple tasks without being side tracked, I cant concentrate at all. I am so irratable, and have mood swings which sucks when you have a 2yr old. I have this anxiety when it comes to \"adulting\"- things like making appointmenst or phone calls give me anxiety, thats unlike me. I used to be intelligent, full of energy, outgoing, and not afraid to deal with adult tasks AT ALL. And to top it all off, im exhausted all day and then cant fall asleep at night, so i also have insomnia. All of this is causing me to feel depressed. Some other symptoms i have: NO sex drive, at all. Restlessness Fatigue, achy muscles. These are things i can remember...as i have memory loss too. At the beginning of the year i decided i didnt want to feel this way and told myself i had to eat better and push myself to exercise no matter how hard it was, it was hard. But i actually do enjoy exercising even though its about the only thing i do in a day. I use all of what i have in energy for this. I was sure that was my problem and would fix everything.... i was wrong. I still feel awful. I feel like im trapped inside myself. I know i have to complete tasks but i just dont have the energy. Anyways, sorry for the long explanation, but here i am today i have typed all my symptoms and done numerous searches and almost everything has led me to believe i could possibly be hypothyroid. (My half sister is hyper and my maternal grandma was hypo) it took me months to actually make the apt, but i see a dr. Thursday. However, its a new dr i have never met before and am anxious about that because i dont know what to say. I don't want to walk in and tell her ive already diagnosed myself, but i also dont want her to brush me off and send me out without thyroid testing...i have made a list of my symptoms to discuss with her. But what else can i do or say to get the help i so desperately need? No one understands my struggle they think im crazy and a hypochondriac, but i KNOW something is wrong with me. I fear she will say im normal and i will be left feeling trapped and still feel so not normal. Please help any advice or opinions are appreciated. Im so lost.\n",
      "Hi all, Ten months ago I began waking up in the night gasping It has been a nightly ordeal for all these months to get any sleep. I went to the doctor who diagnosed me with anxiety. I had taken a sleep apnea test which was negative--though I had one of my rare good nights the night of the test. Holter monitor was negative. Bloodwork at the time was negative. Other symptoms have been fatigue and easily emotional (which could easily be explained by no sleep!) and also shortness of breath on exertion. Even at night when I am at rest, my chest feels tight like it is hard to get a breath. I am married to a family doctor so have had the chance to try other things such as inhalers but they were no help either. This has been a nightmare. I finally got the courage to go back to the internist this week but started crying immediately in his office which is no wonder but makes me look like I have depression which I do not. I am extremely tired and discouraged but no depressed! He asked me suspiciously, \"Your not afraid to go to sleep?\" Well I have been but not recently. I am used to all this gasping and am just plain old discouraged. I am not afraid (my Faith helps me tremendously with that) but I am tired and discouraged as I said. THANKFULLY, he decided to retest the thyroid. I don't know the numbers but the lab is supposed to be mailing me the results. He called me in Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily. Has anyone else experienced this and how long did it take for the meds to help? I have a friend who had this gasping at night symptom for years before a diagnosis...I don't know how often it occurred for her. My husband has been a family doctor for 25 years and has never come across a thyroid patient who awakens gasping at night.\n",
      "Hi everyone I am hoping someone can assist in helping me understand some thyroid results that don't make a whole lot of sense to me. I am sick and tired severely symptomatic hypo but with heypr symptoms also in between I went to a second endo got the same (crazy) look and that I should go back to the gym and perhaps a dermatologist for my dry skin and hair loss even before biopsy results & ignores my other symptoms My ultrasound showed: left lobe nodule and right lobe multi nodular goiter. levels came back : TSH 2.21 (0.27-4.2) FT4 1.41 (0.71-1.85) FT3 3.42 (1.45-4.4) So I went and did antibodies test out my pocket: TPO 0.38 (<34) TgAb 41 (up to 4.11) my radiologist took sample from left lobe nodule but insisted the right lobe has nothing worth biopsying FNA result : hypo cellular smear with few sheet of follicular cells in flat & honey comb pattern the follicular cells are bland without malignant nuclear features. Diagnosis: Lt. thyroid nodule benign c/w adenomatous nodule. HbAlc 5.0 (<6.3) cholesterol 154 (<200) TG 65 (<150) HDL 51 (>40) LDL 76 (<130) I thought about just going on NDT or levo and doing regular blood test if I keep having the same response from my endocrinologists, but now freaking out about the possibility of cancer in the right lobe after TgAb result. I'm frustrated. Any thoughts ?????\n",
      "I'm new here and desperate for some advice/insight into what I've been going through the past few months. I went to my pcp for sudden severe anxiety, along with other symptoms that I now think could be related. She found a large nodule on my thyroid (3.2 cm) and I was referred to an endocrinologist for an ultrasound and biopsy, which came back negative. The endo ordered some blood tests and the results were as follows: TSH - 0.834 (0.4-4.2) Free T3 - 6.7 (1.5-3.5) Free T4 - 0.9 (0.6-1.5) Cortisol - 20.0 at about 10am I have been completely miserable with anxiety, fatigue, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, excessive hunger, horrible hand tremor, heart palpitations, menstrual irregularities, and this doesn't make sense to me, but excessive weight gain. I was put on Prozac for the anxiety and given a beta blocker to take as needed for the symptoms. (I'm a nurse and it's difficult to start IVs with a bad tremor) I was shocked that the endo told me that there was nothing wrong with me because my TSH is normal, despite the elevated T3 and being so symptomatic. I waited 2.5 months for an appointment with another endo to get a second opinion, and he told me the exact same thing! He said that none of my symptoms are related to my thyroid or the nodule because my TSH is normal. From what I've read, all of my symptoms could be explained by my high t3, which could be related to the nodule on my thyroid. Why won't these \"specialists\" look past the TSH?? I feel like they're treating my symptoms and not the problem. Looking for any advice as to what I should do next. Thank you!!\n",
      "Last year I fell ill. Found out I had a thyroid nodule which later on had a thyroidectomy which turned out to be cancer. I'm only 36. During the year prior to surgery I had a nuclear stress test which from what I read is around 9.1 msv of radiation. I had no idea it had that much. Techs just kept telling me its not that much. I had a chest x ray and dental x rays which I know arent much. Then a month before surgery I was having really bad abdominal pain. GI doc had a ct scan ordered for me, but I ended up in the ER 3 days before the appointment. I had the abdominal ct scan done there without any contrast because of my thyroid issue. I see thats around 10 msv. Results came back all normal except for a liver lesion that said might be just blood vessels. GI doc followed up with an MRI which said the same. Was told to do nuclear scan on the liver to make sure its just blood vessels.....which it was. I asked the gi doc about the radiation prior to the scan and said it wasnt much. Even the tech doing it said the same. Now I see it was 3.1 msv. Last week I had a really bad attack on my abdominal area which landed me in the ER again. Went to a different ER. The PA ordered me a ct scan. I brought up to her that I already had a ct scan done within 6 months and she said they dont do MRI's in the ER and it was the only way to see certain things. Me being in so much pain and not thinking clearly I went ahead with it. I again did not do contrast and everything came back normal. I've already had thyroid cancer which I did not have radiation done on, but will if it ever comes back. No idea if it was caused from x rays as a kid or Hashimoto's the auto immune disease I have. Anyways it says I have a 1 in 328 chance of getting another cancer from the dosage but that's still a low chance according to the site. 1 in 328 sounds pretty good to me. My DNA was already clearly messed up ending up with auto immune issues and thyroid cancer so do I have a right to be disappointed or am I worrying about nothing? I have read people have had more ct scans done then me in a short time and are fine, but hard to tell what will happen. 40 msv in a year is a lot though. More then a radiation worker is allowed in a year. I honestly feel let down by these doctors.\n",
      "Long story short, I have been having constant headaches for over two months. Got an MRI and it showed a nodule. Went for the ultrasound and this is the findings FINDINGS The right thyroid lobe measures 6.5 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm, isthmus measures 0.3 cm, and left lobe measures 4.7 x 0.9 x 1.2 cm. There is a large, solid and cystic mass in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 2.8 x 1.9 x 2.5 cm, causing enlargement of the right lobe. There is mild heterogeneity. AP dimension of the left lobe is small. IMPRESSION Solid and cystic nodule in right lower lobe of thyroid. Recommend FNA for further evaluation. HAve not been called for the biopsy yet. Any input on the findings? The tech who did the ultrasound made it sound like they probably wouldnt even do the FNA b/c she said it was cystic and they would probably just watch it.\n",

      "June 4 2016 was the day I decided to go to urgent care , I thought I had an ear infection. The painful swelling in my neck , jaw and ear had come on so quickly . The doctor at the urgent care called an endocrinologist on the floor upstairs and he came right down. Later that afternoon , after an ultrasound and many tubes if drawn blood, I was holding a bottle of Prednisone in my hand . 40mg a day is what it said, that's a lot! Here I am 16 weeks later ,still on the steroids, goin a little crazier every day. I have attempted to slowly back off the steroids three times. Each time I get to 15 mg a day, the immune response is the same as the beginning. It happens fairly quickly, 12-18 hours, my neck swells and the pain returns. It's just an all over bad feeling. How much longer should I have to wait? Why hasn't this dr taken it out yet? I worry about being in these steroids for such a long period of time. I am also on ,100mcg of levothryoxine. I started with 75, blood work at 6 weeks and then the increase in dose.\n",
      "I was recently told by my doctor that my TSH level is 4.97 and T4 is normal but he didn't give me any other information. Does this mean I have an overactive thyroid or under active?\n",
      "I took Armour Thyroid for 20+ years for hypothyroidism and when I had my last labs 5 weeks ago, results showed my thyroid was extremely low and my doctor changed me from 30 mg of Armour to 100 mcg of Synthroid. I was barely functioning when I went to see my doctor as a result of the low thyroid and 5 weeks later, I am still dragging. Should T3 be added to the Synthroid for maximum benefit? I did fine on the Armour until that point, but my doctor said it sometimes stops working as we get older. I was extremely ill last year after I developed Sepsis after back surgery and wonder if the low thyroid might be a result of being so sick. Any suggestions?\n",
      "I got routine blood tests done at 12 weeks pregnant (September 12, 2016) and was referred to an endocrinologist after my TSH levels came back at below 0.01. Since then I've received other out of range lab results including... T3 total: 253 (target range 76-181 ng/dL) Free T3: 459 (target range 210-440 of/dL) Thyroglobulin antibodies: 3 (target range < or = 1 IU/mL) I've also received some in range lab results including... T3 uptake: 26 (target range 22-35%) T4 free direct dialysis: 1.9 (target range 0.8-2.7 ng/dL) Thyroid peroxidase antibodies: 7 (target range <9) After I received these results I was tested for TSI and TBII and both were higher than the target range. TSI: 190 (target range <140) TBII: 21.2 (target range < or = 16%) My endocrinologist thinks I have Graves' disease based on these results. She thinks that I do not currently need medication because my T4 levels are in the target range. I can't find much online about Graves' disease and pregnancy so I'm hoping someone can offer some words of wisdom? Does it affect the baby's development? Currently I am 14 weeks pregnant.\n",
      "Hello! I'm a 25 year old female who has never had any health issues before. I went to my doctor about two weeks ago after I started having occasional heart palpitations. I've had some major life and work changes lately so he was pretty sure it was anxiety but decided to get blood work and thyroid tests just to be sure. He also gave me a prescription for Zoloft and sent me on my way. I had the blood work done that day and had a TSH of .27 and a free T4 of 1.0. The doctor decided he wanted to retest in a week or so and I had the test done again today and I had a TSH of .23. I had expected it to be normal this time, as since I started the Zoloft the heart palpitations are essentially gone. What does it mean that my TSH level changed in a week and a half? And that my T4 is ok? I know that it's impossible to get definitive advice from the internet, but I'm really just looking for anything anyone has to say or advice since I don't even know anyone with thyroid issues. Thanks!!\n",
      "Hi, I had my blood test results back last week and have a high TSH, 7.09 and have TPO antibodies in my blood. Does that mean I have Hashimoto's disease? I have had a sore ulcerated throat for 7 months, achy joints and fatigue and the doctors don't know what is wrong. My doctor suggested I raise my Thyroxine from 75mg to 100mg, but on doing research my blood levels suggest I may have an immune problem? Can anyone help? I don't know what to do as I have seen so many doctors now. I feel as if my symptoms aren't being taken seriously. Should I ask to see an ENT or endocrinologist? Thanks.\n",

I do not know if these symptoms are related or something else wrong in my body, do you? 1. extreme acne 2. swollen, painful tongue and numb lips 3. extreme constipation--(I am taking fiber pills and Miralax daily, and enemas every 2-3 days) 4.insomnia--I know this is a symptom of hyPER, but I am hyPO. Next question--while my body is adjusting to a new dose, is it common to have worse symptoms than I had before? Thanks!\n",
      "I recently had a cuticle infection that required antibiotics (Doxycycline Hyclate). I also take 125 mcg Synthroid. My antibiotics were only for seven days, and I've been done taking them for a week now. The cuticle infection is gone, but I feel completely DRAINED now. Sleeping all the time and still tired, lots of head tension too. It's almost like my hypo symptoms are back full force (extreme fatigue, head tension/fog, eyes feel heavy/droopy). Anyone had a similar experience after antibiotics? Is it possible the antibiotics might have affected the thyroid treatment?\n",
      "So all my life I've been told I don't have any thyroid problems. I had all the things that go with it; Itchy skin, eczema and always cold as hell and gerd. My mother was recently diagnosed with thyroiditis and this time the new doctor got a few extra tests for me just in case. Turns out I'm hypo but I have hyper symptoms as well.. My real question to the board is I noticed the skin between my first knuckle and nail looks and feels super smooth and I'm getting these weird rashes all over my skin and fingers that feel stiff and won't bend. Is this normal? My mother says its not and my doctor seems to think I'm being obsessive.\n",
      "Hey all! I am 59 yo athlete, been on Levothyroxin 50 mcg for 42 years. I asked my doc if I can cut back on the medication, as I feel I have cured my gut health through diet and daily exercise. I am gluten free, follow Paleo diet and am on low FODMAP. I also suffer from another autoimmune issue cerebellar ataxia which I also manage with diet. I started 5 weeks ago and cut my dosage in half to 25 mcg with doctor permission. Had blood drawn and my T4 is at 1.2 and TSH at 1.12. I feel amazing, no weight gain or fatigue, nor any issues. Since my levels on 25 mcg are within normal I asked if I can eliminate it all together, tapering off. My doctor said no, and said don't rock the boat since you feel great. I guess my question is has anyone else done this with success? I am feeling that patients in general are over medicated, making pharma rich, and I don't want to be one of those. Thank you for reading\n",
      "So i have tested several times in the last year and my results always : Low TSH Normal- lower end of normal T4 High-higher end of normal T3 High prolactin levels raised above level 2 times, few months after being normalized medication my neck ultrasound a year ago indicated solitary nodule on the left lobe and my doctor still said all you need is to workout more & eat less fatty food to lose the weight and for all to get back to normal I read enough to know it's not normal, my symptoms are not normal and me not living life NOT NORMAL. So two weeks ago my hypo symptoms started to worsen started feeling neck pain and little pinches on the right side few days later breast pain So i decided to get an ultrasound and long behold a RIGHT lobe goiter with Multi-nodules I though this is symptom of hyperthyroidism!

      "My doctor has once again adjusted my compounded nature thyroid up to accommodate my out of whack thyroid numbers. So....I'm not sure what I'm feeling is related to unregulated thyroid or adrenals starting to fail. Right now I'm feeling fatigued which I understand can be thyroid and adrenal related. However, I've noticed that several freckles have popped up all over my body and somewhat of a rust color on various places on my skin has showed up. Also I do not have any \"fight or flight\" response left.....I get no heart racing or flushing of skin when I encounter a stressful situation or even when I get excited. It's weird.

      "Hello, everyone, it's me again. I just had my T4 and T3 levels tested on Friday and the values are below: FREE T4 0.8 - 1.8 NG/DL = 1.4 NG/DL TRIIODE THYRONINE 76 - 181 NG/DL = 62 NG/DL Since I just had these thyroid tests done, I know I need to make an appointment with my doc to discuss treatment. I'm also taking 50,000 IUs of Vitamin D every Saturday (for 12 weeks) as prescribed from my gastroenterologist because that was low. I have a couple questions about weird symptoms that have been going on all weekend that have been freaking me out in the extreme. Saturday started out with me being very jittery, even after I had a sandwich. I haven't had coffee in weeks -- I just had water and a glass of Rooibos tea. The jittery feeling eventually went away, but was replaced by a dull ache in the fronts of both thighs. That came and went all day, and eased up by bedtime. I've been a regular walker/jogger for years, but I've never had this kind of ache occur before. I got a good night's sleep for the most part, but when I woke up, my thighs started aching in earnest as soon as my feet touched the floor. I eventually went back to bed for a couple hours and took 4 ibuprofen, and that helped a little. When I woke up for good later, the achy feelings came back, again in both thighs. Eventually, they dissipated. These boards have helped immensely in determining symptoms and treatments, so I have to ask: Are these symptoms indicative of hypothyroidism or Hashimotos or diabetes or prediabetes? I also have been tracking my blood glucose for the past week, and some days, the fasting BG is 94-97 and on other days, it's 103-105. Two hours after I've eaten, it's never risen above 145. Most times it's 120-125. I am very scared at all of this, as I am going to be starting a new job soon and I don't need health problems on top of it. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? How does anyone function with this until they get treatment? Thanks for your help!\n",
      "Hi, Everyone Last time I had a blood test my TSH result was \"5\". The worst was \"8\" and my best so far was \"4\". It seems to bounce around based on what I happen to be eating. \"8\" was the result of my first test when I wasn't aware that food mattered. After doing some research I changed my diet and the result was \"4\". My last one was 5. At the end of this month I'm due for a blood test for t3 and t4. What foods should I avoid besides(raw) cruciferous vegetables, soy products, peaches and peanuts? I just read that polyunsaturated fats interfere with thyroid function and that I should be getting my fats from nuts and seeds rather than avocados. BTW, my ultrasound test was clear and I have no symptoms of hypothyroidism. Any additional ideas or comments?\n",
      "I have had Hoshimotos for 5 years. For the first 4 years, my dosage fluctuated quite a bit, which was difficult to dose. For the last year or so I have been at a stable, daily 88 mg per day and feeling better finally. Until about 8 weeks ago, when I was feeling like my thyroid levels were high. I reduced my dosage to 75/88 every other day (average of 81.5 per day), which gave my symptoms like I was low. I switched back to 88 every day and have been feeling high again. I had some blood tests when I was feeling high, which told me I was in a normal range, a little on the high side. Being high or low is very hard for me and can pretty much wreck my life. I am sure some of you can relate. Up till now, I was always able to find a comfortable range but it seems to me like my stable zone is probably close to 85mg per day. I know the difference is dosage seems quite small but I am an extremely sensitive person. Maybe it is because I have T1 diabetes or maybe I am just naturally sensitive anyway. Regardless. Has anyone had an experience where they are trying to hone in on a dosage range that they don't make a pill for? Can I consider 75/75/88 every three days (which seems a bad option) or do I request that my doctor give me a prescription for 75mg and 10mg? Any advise welcome. Thanks.\n",

      "I went to my family doctor because of difficulty swallowing, a feeling of fullness in my throat, fatigue & neck pain (to the side of my thyroid). He thought it was my thyroid right away & sent me for a blood test which only showed my wbc count was low. TSH was normal I also got an ultrasound which showed 4 or 5 nodules split between the 2 sides. At least one had calcification. 2 are 9mm, the rest are smaller So he then wanted a fine needle biopsy but the nodules have to be 1cm in size. He wanted to send me for the iodine uptake - but the nodules are too small & OHIP won't pay for it. So he sent me to an ENT I went today. I watched 5 people go in & out of the office in about 30 min, all seeing the same ENT. My appointment lasted 9 min & included him sticking a camera in my nose. Basically, I kept asking questions even though it was obvious he wanted me to go So, his diagnosis (& I feel like he made up his mind even before I walked in the room) is acid reflux & he wrote me a script for stuff to reduce the acid in my stomach. I asked about several of my symptoms & he kept saying \"oh that can't be caused by this, that can't be caused by this\". I asked if the trouble swallowing & throat fullness could be caused by the nodules & his answer was no I said it is a heck of a co-incidence that ALL my symptoms started at the same time, even though most (according to him), could not be caused by reflux or my thyroid & he responded \"we have to learn to accept these things when we are a senior\". I'm 42 & a fairly active 42 at that. Finally, after me telling him i don't buy into the reflux theory, he said \"oh I may be wrong & if I am, we'll try something different in 3 months\" I have a physical with my family doctor in 5 weeks. I would like to ask him to order the blood tests for Hashi's. I think a lot of my symptoms match up with that & I have celiac's so another auto immune disorder isn't too crazy of an idea Is it possible/long enough of a trial to send me to a different ENT if the acid reducer is not improving things? In fact, even if it is, I'd rather not see that ENT again Thanks very much for letting me vent\n",
      "Hi. I'm all very new to this as I had swollen feet and ankles and my feet were really painful to walk on so I went to the Drs thinking I had arthritis. I was totally shocked when they called me with the results and I have an overactive thyroid. I've spent my whole life feeling tired and have recently gained 20lbs after getting a dog and walking at least 6 miles a day! There was no way I thought I had an over active thyroid. My sister is hypo but after speaking to the dr he thinks I will eventually end up hypo too as he said most patients do!?! I've been taking 20mg of carbamazole for 4 weeks and I've not really noticed any difference and my feet are still killing me. It's embarrassing when I stand up in the office at work as I hobble like I'm in my 90's! I think my gp has referred me to a specialist and he told me my results after 3 weeks of meds had gone from 40 to 29 so after some research I assume that's my T4 levels?

I'm gutted I'm back on medication as I had a pulmonary embolism in January and had just stopped taking warfarin and now this! I turn 50 at the weekend but feel like I might as well be turning 90!

      "Just a quick background: I have been dealing with voice and throat issues for almost 5 years. I have a constant tickle in my throat, hoarse voice, and a raw, painful throat by the end of the day. I also have an extremely hard time running because it makes me have to cough and my throat gets tight. I have had so many tests done for asthma, reflux, vocal cord disorders and had no luck. I keep telling my doctor that I feel like something is in my throat, but they have not been able to find anything. Last week, my doctor suggested I get a thyroid ultrasound. At first I thought it was a long shot- I don't have many symptoms associated with thyroid problems. However, the more research I did, I found that my symptoms actually do make sense with thyroid nodules. It turns out that the sore throats, hoarseness, even the tickle a can be explained by the presence of one or more nodule. I went for the ultrasound and discovered there were in fact nodules- 5 of them (one 7mm, four 4mm or less.) When I got the report today, the doctor said that they were too insignificant to worry about and just suggested I get another ultrasound in 6 months to follow-up. I am a little surprised and frustrated by this. I have basically been called crazy for the past 5 years when all of the tests came up negative. I finally found a physical cause for the troubles I am having, and my doctor is choosing to ignore them. I know these nodules are small compared to some. and would generally go unnoticed by patients. However, is it possible that nodules of these sizes could be causing my issues? Thanks in advance!\n",
      "Hi all. I'm not new here, but it's been a while. I've searched through the boards, but cannot find much information that comforts my worries or answers my question(s). In May of this year, I was diagnosed with thyroid disfunction. I've had a goiter for as long as I can remember, but my thyroid function has always been within range. I've long suspected that my thyroid/goiter has been the reason for my chronic fatigue. Finally, in May, it reared it's head. To make a long story short, I began taking Levothyroxine 25 mcg and worked my way up to 50 mcg. However, over the next several weeks, I developed chronic sweating, which I know is quite normal. I can handle that, but not the horrible smell that comes with it. My neck and head, where I sweat most of the time, smells like vinegar. It's a really sour smell. It's very, very embarassing, but what can I do? Now I notice this smell every single morning after I wake up. Is it at all possible that the medication could be the cause? My doctor doesn't think so, nor does the internet. I really cannot find any information. I sweat easily, even before taking this medication, but my sweat has never, ever, ever, ever had an odor. I do not want to stop the medication because I feel so much better, but I cannot handle this much longer. My clothes are slowly becoming trapped within this stench. Any advice?

      "Hello, I'm new. I'm also pretty much a catastrophe, and I'm trying to figure out why. So, I've had idiopathic intracranial hypertension (a rareish neurological disorder, basically my cerebrospinal fluid pressure is too high) for the past few years. It's responded well to treatment with Diamox, but I have to be very careful about my potassium levels (since it isn't a potassium-sparing diuretic) and blood pH (since it can cause acidosis). Flash back to a year ago, I begin feeling some chest discomfort and irregular heartbeats after sex. Thinking I might have overexerted myself into hypokalemia, I go to the ER. While in the ER, I have an episode of Tachy that got up to 162 bpm. It fixed itself after a couple vasovagal maneuvers, and I didn't need any medication to bring it under control. They got an EKG of the event, kept me overnight, next day the staff cardiologist says everything looks fine. Normal electrolytes, normal (though fast) EKG. I have a history of anxiety, which I actually wasn't experiencing at the time, so he gave me propranolol to use as needed. I take about 10mg and it controls my symptoms passably well. Diamox can cause tachycardia, and the other side effects it was giving me were worse than my IIH symptoms, so I weaned off of it until I can see a new Neuro to discuss other treatment options. Anyhow, here's my problem-- I have noticed that gastric upset is a huge Tachy trigger for me. I've also noticed that sexual arousal (even in dreams) will trigger it too, and I'm not even on any medications that might be responsible for that. Sometimes, I'll get it randomly accompanied by nausea and sweaty hands and feet. I don't drink, smoke, or consume caffeine. I've also experienced eczema, joint pain, weight loss, trouble sleeping, loose stools, jumpiness, a couple of weirdly high glucose readings (I'm not diabetic), and a crazy-high level of anxiety for awhile now. I've had a doctor mention that one side of my thyroid felt enlarged in the past, but had a normal thyroid panel at the time (years ago). I'm getting ready to request another one from a new doctor, but, in the meantime, I want to know: could a hyperthyroid condition explain why my body feels like a soccer riot? Can thyroid symptoms vary with a woman's hormonal cycle?\n",
      "Hi everyone! I'm new to the board - this is my first post! I joined to find out if anyone on here can recommend an amazing doctor in my area that can help me. I've had hashimotos for 10 years - I was diagnosed at 18 years old after I had my first (and very traumatic) birth. During that time I was under a TON of stress (obviously, I was pregnant in high school) and in an abusive relationship. I started on synthroid and was better in a few weeks - no symptoms..ever....Fast forward a few years - I ended that relationship, moved on with my life - got married to a wonderful man. We had 3 children in 5 years. I would go from nursing one to being pregnant again. We decided we were done after the 3rd one (who is now 2). When I decided to begin weaning (she was a little over a year) that is when everything shifted. It started with a a fever one night, and the next night I couldn't sleep - at all - not even for one minute. My heart was pounding, and I had terrible anxiety. I thought it was just a weird night, and went to bed early the next night. Of course, again I could not sleep! Since then I haven't slept - a few hours here and there. That was 10 months ago. I thought it was my hormones/cycle coming back. But I've had a lot of periods..and they are all normal. They come at the same time, I don't have heavy bleeding. BUT the night before it comes I'm extra anxious and usually have another night of no sleep. Anything that is stressful - I can't handle. I'm getting sick constantly with colds/viruses (which I usually never get). I have 4 daughters - I homeschool 2 of them. I need to be well! I've been to countless doctors! My TSH is always \"in range\". My last test showed that my TSH was 3.5 - which is much higher then usual. I've been at the 1.6-1.8 range for 9 years - even through pregnancies! I've never had to change my dose. I finally went to a different \"out of the box thinker\" doctor - she took 30 vials of blood - and diagnosed me with reactivated Epstein Barr Virus. She started me on DHEA and naturethroid in addition to my tirosinit (capsule form of synthroid). I took the DHEA and it made me crazy - more anxious then usual. I just took my first dose of naturethroid and I feel SO strange! Dizzy, and just unwell. I thought all of these symptoms were either my female hormones leveling out, then I thought it was my Hashimotos..but now I'm wondering about this EBV. Can this be causing all of my crazy symptoms? Could my thyroid just be off because of the infection? Anyone else had this happen to them with naturethroid? Can anyone recommend a doctor they love that has helped them (I'm in the Charlotte, NC area)? Has anyone else dealt with the EBV & Hashimotos? Thanks!!!\n",

      "I am hoping someone can answer my questions about my experience with Synthroid. About 3.5 years ago, my PCP diagnosed me with hypothyroidism after a TSH level that was slightly elevated. It didn't make sense to me, because I had some symptoms of hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism, but I went along with it, not realizing how complex treating endocrine problems is. After I took the first pill, I had this amazing feeling of energy and clarity; my brain fog completely disappeared, and I felt great (but not hyperactive). This lasted about 6 hours and then I went back to how I was before (tired, foggy, etc.). The following day, I had the same feeling but it didn't last as long. During the following weeks, I felt worse, and at 6 weeks, I felt worse than when I started the Synthroid. However, my PCP said my TSH was 'normal' after the follow up blood test at 6 weeks, so everything was fine. When I told him I felt worse, he yelled at me and said he was not going to raise my dose. I told him I didn't know if my dose should be raised or lowered but I didn't feel right. Finally, I was able to wrangle a referral to an endo, but it took about 3 additional weeks to get an appointment. By the time I saw the endo, I had developed symptoms of full-blown hypothyroidism - exhaustion, joint pain, ear ringing, eye problems, painful lymph nodes, headache, slurring words, memory problems, shortness of breath, and more. The endo told me to stop taking the Synthroid. After some testing, the endo said he could find nothing wrong, and the last thing he said was that I should go back on the Synthroid (because my TSH was normal, lol). I did not. Over the past 3 years, I have partly recovered, but I am now feeling worse again. I am going to another endo this week, and I am now trying to get all my ducks in a row. My main question is why did I feel so great immediately after taking the Synthroid? Is it perhaps related to cortisol? And second, why did I then crash? I have tried to understand how the endocrine system works but can't figure it out, although this might partly be the brain fog. If anyone could give me a biological/medical answer, it would be greatly appreciated! By the way, I was tested for Hashimoto's three years ago (as well as various autoimmune diseases). All tests were negative. Thank you!\n",

      "Hi all I'm new here. I just got back from the gp and have been told o have a very over active thyroid. I had a baby 9 months ago and have not felt well since I developed diabetes but I also started feeling very dizzy and have lost an extreme amount of weight and many other symptoms along with anxiety etc. Whilst it is good to understand what is wrong it has scared me a lot . I have been given Carbimazole to take three times a day. Can any one give any advice on how I can help myself and any reassuring info. I'm just worried due to just having a baby and trying to cope. I hate taking meds but will do it if I have to. I am also being referred to a specialist. Thank you\n",
      "Hello all, I am not sure if this has been posted yet, but I am a 27year old male, diagnosed with Graves Disease over 4 years ago and my Endo has decided it is time to go ahead and have my thyroid completely removed (as much of it as possible) and I am now searching for a surgeon who has LOTS of experience in larger than normal thyroidectomys. I have yet to get my CT SCAN of the neck but am scheduling that asap. I am looking for the best surgeon in FL, as my insurance will cover that, however I am scheduled to have PPO insurance starting 9/1 if there is a more experienced surgeon elsewhere. Any advice is appreciated and I hope somebody responds. Thanks, Alex\n",
      "Hi I recently took a thyroid uptake scan following an ultrasound, and need help interpretting the results. \"Scan demonstrates mild gland enlargement. There is suggestion of multi nodularity with a focus of mildly increased activity at the left upper pole and several foci of mildly reduced activity located just below the left upper pole, just below the right upper pole and somewhat equivocally, at the left lower pole. IMPRESSION: Radioiodine uptake levels are within the upper range of normal. Scan demonstrates mild gland enlargement with a suggestion of multi nodularity including both mildly hyperfunctioning and hypofunctioning regions. The 24 hour uptake level is slightly higher (30%) than on the previous study of June 2013 when it was 21%. The focal increase of activity at the left upper pole currently seen was not previously noted.\"\n",

      "Hi. I'm a 32 year old female. For years I have been suffering from fatigue, weight gain despite a low cal organic diet and heavy weight training and hiit cardio, cold all the time, yet hot at night, acne, mild anxiety and depression. Recently these symptoms have gotten worse. I gained 8 lbs in the past 3 weeks (4 of which were in 3 days) and I am really lacking motivation. My father is an internist and ran my numbers. My results are: TPO-17iu/ml (0-35) FT4- 1.5 mg/dl (.8-1.8) TSH-.7 mcIU/ml (.5-5.2) Total T3- 86 mg/dl (76-181) RT3- 21ng/dl (8-25) RT3 T3 ratio- 4.1 (>10) Parathyroid- 44 pg/ml (9-69) Leptin- 6.2 mg/ml One thing I do know is my iron saturation had been low for over 6 years. It used to be 10% now it's 14% Iron- 47mcg/dL (30-160) TIBC- 327 Saturation- 14% (15-55%) Cholesterol- 179mg/dl (70-199) Triglycerides- 34 mg/dl (30-149) HDL- 72 mg/dl (40-90) LDL- 100 mg/dl (50-129) Insulin- <2 Glucose- 83 mg/dl (60-99) Vit D- 48 mg/ml (25-80) Cortisol- 12.8 mcg/dl (4.0-27) I had read about reverse t3 ratio and leptin and had my father run those tests for me. I do notice that while my numbers are normal the ratio is too low. I also have read low iron can cause this and I have been low for years. I can't find a doctor who acknowledges anything. Says I'm fine and eat 1100 calories a day vs 1200-1500 that I eat now. I don't know what to do because I don't feel well and feel there is something wrong. Also my mom has hashimotos and my dad is on synthroid. Please help!!\n",
      "Hi, guys. I'm a 28-year-old male who was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease in January. I have a question about my hair-loss pattern: can hypothyroidism mimic male-pattern baldness? The outer third AND inner third of my eyebrows have significantly thinned, though it's most noticeable on the outside. What concerns me more, however, is the way I'm losing my hair. There is some diffuse thinning, but the section of hair at the very front of my forehead has thinned dramatically in the last two years, and in just the last year my hairline has actually moved back somewhat. If it were not for the Hashimoto's, I would assume I was just going bald. But can Hashimoto's hair loss look this way in a man? And can I expect that my hair will return once I begin medication (I'm seeing the endocrinologist next month)?\n",
      "I had my thyroid seared with radioactive iodine in 2003, I prescribed Synthroid. I weighed 110 when I was diagnosed. I gained to 138 within 3 mos. I started to cut back eating and exercised. It got the point where I got to 124 lbs and stayed at that weight. I got pregnant with my daughter and after I had her, exercised and dieted. I literally was eating one meal a day. I went from 175 to 132 lbs and seems stuck on that weight. Someone told me about Armour Thyroid and I started taking it in 2010. I lost 6 lbs within the first week and got down to 112 within a month time. This was along with exercise and careful eating. 2010-2012 I maintained 112 lbs. In 2012 I went through a divorce, gave up exercising and gained weight. I got to 124 lbs by 2015. All along still on Armour. This past year, I gained 14 lbs - leaving me at the weight of 138 on Armour. I have put exercising back into place but it seems to be not coming off. I started to research. Forest changed the formula and a lot of people were getting off it. This last month, my pharmacist refilled my Armour with NP Thyroid. I did not notice until I put it into my mouth and the consistency was notably different. I researched the internet. I found that in 2013, there were a could of posts stating that NP Thyroid is like the old Armour formula before it was reformulated.\n",
      "ok so i need some reassurance that this is not dangerous!...i have been feeling constant throat tightness/compression like a rope around my neck for 4 weeks now, i have done numerous doctor visits and no one was able to find anything simply saying it was a sore throat/ or gastric related, until my doctor ordered a neck ultrasound just a week ago and it turns out i have a nodule of 13mm even though in reality its bigger if the doctor was able to feel it with his hands. I am also having difficulty swallowing foods, i am able to swallow in small bites but after finishing each meal i feel the residue in my throat that feeling as if something is stuck. i had a barium swallow test done and the report was the same, stated that dry foods lasted a bit longer to go down and some residue was seen. I have been feeling extremely anxious due to this problem, still waiting on that referral to the ENT doctor for a biopsy. meanwhile i have no clue if this can aggravate my throat compression? waiting more time like this\n",
      "Hi, Since 2011 I have been having periods of arm and leg muscles pain. Pains range from mild constant ache (like after the gym..) to acute spasms and weakness. Each period lasted less than a month. My TSH was elevated since 2011 (4 <TSH<5). Last Dec I had something going on with the thyroid. Hot all the time, weakness in the legs , lost 12lb in two weeks (i was pretty thin before) and had some pain in the neck.Didnt see a doc. Last April during one of those episodes I did some blood and TSH was 10, Free T3 over the range. I was started on 25mcg levothyroxine. Since then it increased every 6 weeks to the current dose of 75mcg. Finally the question, With the 25mcg I took iron & b vits. Feeling quite well. Since the dose increased to 50mcg if I take iron or vit b I wake up at 3am with pain in my legs, heart beating and some sweat. With iron it is worse. Pain takes more than half a day to pass. Tried many times. I could take lots of vit b and not feel a thing before the levothyroxine or on 25mcg. Has anybody had that from taking iron/vitb? My serum iron,TIBC, ferritin are low. My Hb borderline low.(sometimes under range) I'm a male. (less likely it would be low?)\n",

My arms and legs have been aching everyday for the past few weeks. I am also just so tired all the time. I am having a hard time eating but just last week was diagnosed with gastritis.

      "Hi, I'm Julie. I've been getting symptoms of hypothyroidism for many years, mainly unexplained weight gain, frequent depressive episodes and terrible insomnia. I've also suffered from mood swings and very heavy and painful periods. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 14 years, but only yesterday, having visited my gp yesterday, he said blood tests I had taken 3 years ago, which I was told were normal, had clearly shown that my thyroid was underractive. He's sent me for more tests, finally. I'm wondering, and always have about the bipolar diagnosis as is he, as all my symptoms when I read your site are just me to a T. It will surely be a very bitter pill to swallow if I was to find out I've been treated and grossly over medicated for 14 years, but I can't turn the clocks back. My main question is, if my results again come back suggesting I do have hypothyroidism, will treatment alleviate the weight problems ( which prior to the commencement of drug treatment for a disease I've never been convinced I had, and more importantly the terrible and crippling fatigue and insomnia be helped if they get the levels right. Sorry to warble on, I feel that perhaps the solution is in my grasp soon, but I don't want to be over hopeful. Thanks for listening 😀\n",

      "This is a relatively long one - I apologize in advance. In August of 2015, I had some blood work done that showed a slightly elevated TSH level that my then GP did nothing about. Fast forward to March 2016 - My hair had began falling out (no major bald spots thank god, but major thinning and was coming out in handfuls) and I was exhausted all of the time. My new GP decided to put me on a trial dose of 25 mcg of Levothyroxine once per day based off of my previous blood work, with orders to come back in six weeks to get retested. Six weeks later, I came in and the blood test showed that my TSH had actually increased (not a drastic amount, but still) - but because she didn't seem worried, I wasn't either (she says now that she told me to schedule a follow up, but I don't remember this). Fast forward again to June 2016. I came down with a slight sore throat, that was gone in just a few days, nothing to write home about. After that, I had a swollen Uvula. Again, I'd had this before and it was gone within a day or two, not a big deal. However, I haven't felt good since. My hair loss is still occuring, I'm still exhausted and now I have a new meriad of symptoms to deal with. It feels like there is constantly a lump in my upper throat and like someone is applying pressure or squeezing my neck (lower throat). I sometimes feel myself gasping for air, like I can't seem to get enough air. There are nights that I struggle to sleep, leading me to sleep the rest of the day away (which is just not plausible for a 25 year old woman to do). When I went back to the GP, she said that I had swollen tonsils, a few swollen lymph nodes, and that my thyroid was enlarged. A whole myriad of blood work was ran (it came back fine), a Mono test (it was negative) and a Thyroid Ultrasound (I'm told it was normal, no nodules, but the hospital is....less than the best). She seems absolutely stumped, even as I've asked repeatedly for her to run tests for Thyroid Antibiodies only for her to refuse and now refer me to an ENT. I'd probably not be as worried, but my father passed away two years ago from Esophageal Cancer (I'm not sure what type), and we share some of the same symptoms. I'll post the results of my most recent bloodwork in a reply to this post. What tests will an ENT run that my GP couldn't/wouldn't? Will he try a different thyroid ultrasound? Will he recommend a CT Scan?\n",
      "Hi all, Approx 10 weeks ago I noticed my neck was swollen. I was having neck pain, hoarseness, insomnia and a feeling of a lump in the throat. I went to my GP who didn't really take me seriously but agreed to a basic thyroid test. This came back ok so he sent me on my way. I was unhappy with this so had a private test done. These are my results: TSH 0.992 range 0.27-4.2. Free T4 22.87 range 12-22. Free T3 3.8 range 3.1-6.8. TPO antibodies were negative. The doctor said the results are an indication of borderline hyperthyroidism. Is this serious enough to go back to my GP or should I leave it? My neck is still swollen and I still feel as if I have mucous in my throat though I don't have much pain and the hoarseness has gone. The insomnia comes and goes but is generally better.\n",

      "Hello to all, I would like to ask what your thoughts are for taking the thyroid medicine Levoxyl. I am now and have been for 15 years taking 75mg. daily, have had to remove one pill every few months generally two months to bring about some of the side effects of being over mediated. My age is 67, woman and having no thyroid as it was ablated back in 2001 for dx of Graves disease. Recently the last few months (3-4) more symptoms of being over mediated have shown up and to the point of being very uncomfortable. I have removed three pills in less than two weeks to feel some relief, but as it was back on \"track\" with taking the medicine daily this still was presenting some of the same symptoms, heat intolerance, rapid heart more more bowel movements/urination, insomnia and high anxiety, also right eye weeping everyday. I had the levels checked after the two weeks removal of the three pills and at the point the TSH was 3.66 and the Free T4 was 1.5. I would like to ask if anyone with no thyroid has had to reduce the daily replacement after taking it as I have? The doctors don't seem to be giving me the best solutions and with anyone's experience this would be helpful to get some added insight. Thank~you!\n",

I have mentioned the possibility of PCOS, but I am always dismissed because I am not overweight and don't have excessive hair growth. I am 5'7\" 124 pounds, losing hair on the top of my head and so tired of being tired. I am a vegan and eat very clean. My protein, zinc, glucose and gluten levels are all normal. My family doctor always says \"well, we can put you back on birth control pills to stop you periods again,\" but that sure doesn't feel like a solution. I hate how I feel on birth control and I would like to know what is actually going on. Any thoughts? I am so frustrated.\n",
      "I was on nature throid (4 grains) for about 7 years. It was great for me. A doctor that was new to me at the time transitioned me onto Levothyroxine (50 every day and 75 on top of that twice a week)when I became pregnant 4 years ago. I stayed on it for 4 years while I had two babies and breastfed them. I just finished breast-feeding and asked my doctor to put me back on naturethroid. She put me on one grain. I have felt terrible since I have been on it. Nausea, diarrhea, headaches. The days have been unbearable to get through. I really would prefer to be on nature throid though. My doctor doesn't know what to do. Do I cut my dose down to a half pill tomorrow morning? Please help!\n",
      "Hi, I've recently become aware due to a blood test that I may well be struggling with symptoms of Hypothyroidism and not Fibro (as diagnosed in 2011) or that the urticaria I've been struggling massively with since 2012 is 'idiopathic' but due to Thyroid problems. I came off meds recently as the urticaria seemed to stop after 2 years of being on Cyclosporine to suppress my immune system, sadly after a couple of weeks the urticaria came back with a vengeance on my head and back of neck. I decided to have a Thyroid blood test done privately as I'd read that the NHS don't do a thorough or comprehensive test when it comes to Thyroid testing. My results show that TSH is within 'normal' range at 1.48 but Antibodies are raised: Anti-Thyroidperoxidase abs H 169.4 <34 Anti-Thyroglobulin Abs H 146.7 <115 I've done a lot of reading and it would appear that my symptoms and result indicate I may well be/am looking at Hashimotos. (edited to add) Other results are: T4 total: 90.7 Free T4 12.07 Free T3 4.82 Reverse T3 15.0 Reverse T3 Ratio 20.92 >20 I have an appointment with Immunology at hospital on Friday and wondered if anyone could please give me some info or advice as to what I should be asking/questioning at this appointment? I'm dreading being put back on Cyclosporine or Prednisolone again as I honestly feel that I've been misdiagnosed for about 10-12 years now and receiving the wrong treatment. As so many others probably feel, I've had just about enough of feeling so crappy all the time. Tia x\n",

      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "Hi, I believe I have either hyper or hypothyroidism. For the past few months I've been showing weird symptoms, starting out with just general fatigue (originally just attributed this to depression from a breakup) for about 3-4 months to daytime sleepiness to depression. So for 6 months, and possibly longer, I was showing some weird symptoms, all of which I attributed to depression. A week ago I was in class when something just felt off. I'm not sure what it was but it led to me driving home. While driving I felt like I was almost going to faint... my heart wasn't beating that hard but I was panicked for seemingly no reason at all. It felt like the world was collapsing. I came home and slept for a while. Upon waking up a few hours later my vision was left with tracing images and it was impossible to make sense of anything. Images stayed in my vision as I looked around and I was totally confused. I ran out to tell my dad to drive me to the ER as I was convinced I had a brain tumor. They ran tests on my, ekg and everything and everything came back good. My vitals were good, blood oxygen level, my blood pressure was a little high for myself (150/100) but they paid it no mind. I was released. The next day came chest beating and other symptoms. Again, I freaked out and went to urgent care. Vitals were checked. They referred me to X-rays. Everything was fine, blood pressure was high for me at 150/100, pulse was around 60-70 which is also high for me, as my resting BPM is 39-42. I began experiencing tremors, pins and needles, sensitivity to cold, eye pain, head pain, frequent urination, muscle weakness and a few other symptoms. This was about 2 days ago. I managed to get a doctor's visit and they're doing lab tests to see if I have hyper/hypothyroidism, and the results should come in soon. They said they'd call me back. But the distressing part is where I had to get another appointment for 3 weeks later. That means I possibly will not be receiving medication for it for another 3 weeks while all of this is happening. Am I safe? Did I go through thyroid storm? The symptoms were very sudden and somewhat strong. Thanks. (My bpm is now back to normal it seems, 42, and my blood pressure is 110/60)\n",
      "Ive been on anti-thyroid med for 7 weeks so far and bloodwork was done a couple days ago TSH: 0.01 (range .34-5.0) FT4: 1.77 (range .60-1.80) Total T3: 185 (range 87-190) TSH remained the same as before FT4 went up from 1.2 to 1.77 Total T3 (not sure why he cares for this test, instead of FT3) went up as well. From 160 to 185. Hes up'd my meds to double the dosage, from 10-20mg Im taking the meds in generic form, with light food. Is there a reason why it hasnt worked yet? Too low a dosage? He started talking to me about RAI but Im very, very hesitant to take it. My images from nuclear medicine scan showed possibly being radio-resistant to such a treatment. Meaning that if I take 15 (mcg?) of RAI, it could not work and require another dosage weeks later. Not to mention the horrible effects of RAI to begin with. Any suggestion on what I coould do, to help improve things? Thanks\n",
      "I was diagnosed about 3 years ago after having my daughter. my tsh was 154, when it should be max 4. So ridiculously high, the doctor quickly put me on levothyroxine. i have had my dosage upped a bit since then, recently i got retested and my tsh is 224. So what i dont understand is why it´s higher when i´ve been on levothyroxine. I wonder if i am not absorbing iodine or if it´s some other problem. I still have not been to the doctor because my insurance likes to take their time. other symptoms that i´ve had are anxiety, like terrible anxiety. Irritability, mood swings, irregular periods, numb limbs, dizziness, eye twitching, shooting pains in abdomen, blurry vision, confusion, weight gain that doesn´t come off with exercise, mental fogginess, lack of concentration, fatigue. HORRIBLE! please anyone who can share an experience or some knowledge about something my doctor is missing on this whole thing, please! i´m desperate!! I´m 21 and this is crippling my life. I also have psoriasis, which gets worse on and off. i´ve stopped eating sugar and gluten to help the psoriasis, and have read it helps hypo, but no relief! HELP! I have only been tested for tsh and t4, t3. not the other tests for thyroid.\n",
      "Over the last few year I've have extreme fatigue, 30 lbs in weight gain, and thinning hair, I also have had a constant non-stop ringing in my left ear for over a year, leg cramps, really achy joints, brain fog. So last week I paid to have my own thyroid blood work done so I could make an appt with a Dr. (I don't have insurance) and bring the results with me, I'm not sure what the numbers mean so I'll just post all that were on the test I ordered. Blood work (2016) TSH 1.22 (0.40-4.50) Free T4 1.0 (0.8-1.8 ng/dL) Free T3 2.7 (2.3-4.2 pg/mL) T3, Total 83 (76-181 ng/dL) T3 Uptake 31 (22-35%) T4 (Thyroxine), Total 6.6 (4.5-12.0 mcg/dL) Free T4 Index (T7) 2.0 (1.4-3.8) Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies 2 (<9 IU/mL) Thyroglobulin Antibodies <1 (< or = 1 IU/mL) T3 Reverse, LC/MS/MS 17 (8-25 ng/dL) The numbers are all in the specified range, so does that mean they are all \"normal\". I have a Dr. appt coming up, I'm going to bring these results and have him look them over, however I'd like to have so personal knowledge before I go into the Dr. office. BTW, I still have the constantly needing to clear my throat feeling all day long.\n",
      "So the long story...my son was born 12 years ago, and shortly after giving birth I began to feel unwell😷. My lovely Dr ran some tests which came back to show my thyroid was overactive, we discussed what this would mean in terms of treatment. The Dr monitored me and repeated the tests two weeks later. This time the results showed that my thyroid was now underactive. I was started on levothyroxine, after a 18 months of treatment I saw a specialist at the hospital. The specialist explained that I had Post partum thyroiditis which normally returns to normal however because of the amount of time I have been experiencing the problem I would mostly likely have to continue treatment for life😕. When my son was 3, we moved from Plymouth back to my hometown in the Midlands. I registered at a new GP, and continued to be regularly monitored. Previously I had been taking between 125mg and 150mg of levothyroxine depending on the results from regular tests and during this time I felt normal on this dose, I was happy, healthy, I wasn't over weight, I regularly went swimming and to the gym😀. After a while with my new GP my dose was lowered to 100mg and then 75mg and then shockingly I was told that I should stop taking levothyroxine as my results showed that my levels were normal and I no longer needed it😱. I was in total disbelief and questioned the GP but he insisted that I should stop taking the medication. During this time I was gradually putting on weight, and finding I had less and less energy😰. For, a number of years I continued to suffer. I changed GPs again, and begged to have my thyroid checked. I was repeatedly told that I was within a normal range or its borderline underactive but just within the range so no need for treatment despite my symptoms😤. Over the last 5 years my symptoms have progressively got worse. To the point where I can barely function enough to manage normal daily activities😴. Last November I was repeatedly seeing different doctor's for problems with sleep and feeling tired, I was close to giving up I was feeling that low and that exhausted by it all 😢. The Dr was about to send me out of the door with a new prescription for some sleeping tablets when I casually said 'do you think we could run some bloods tests to see if there is anything contributing to my sleeping problems?' he responded with...'hmm yes that seems like a reasonable request' and so tests were done...again. This time it showed my thyroid was once again underactive 😱. I was started on 25mg of levothyroxine and told to have the test repeated in 2-3 months (My TSH was 6.something). The results of my next test came back higher so my dose was increased to 50mg ( My TSH was 7.something). My third test had spiked even more which explained why I was feeling worse than when I was diagnosed, my dose was once again increased this time to 75mg (My TSH was 9.something). In my next test it showed a slight improvement compared to the previous one but I was still over the normal range so I was told to alternate between 75mg and 100mg as it was feared that increasing too much would send me the other way (My TSH was 8.something). During this time my Doctor was also treating me for depression. This became her primary concern, and although I was trying to explain that in my mind I felt like I wanted to get out and do something active and felt excited about things that were happening in my personal life but my body was so physically exhausted I just wasn't able to do the things that I want to do. Her response was that I should give it time and when my mind has healed by body would heal too 😤. I wanted to scream! 😬 Thankfully at my next review she was off sick. I saw a lovely young doctor, who for the first time in 7 months made me feel like it wasn't all in my head. He listened to how I was feeling and he took the time to explain what was happening to my thyroid gland and why they looked at TSH. He reassured me that we will fix this and I will feel normal again. He increased my dose to 125mg. I returned last week to get my results, there has been no change at all even with the new dose (My TSH is still 8.something). He confirmed that I have the Hashimotos antibodies. He has now increased my dose again, this time bumping it up to 200mg in the hope that we can get to the bottom of this and hopefully I can start living my life again😓. In the last week, I haven't felt any different but I no it will take time. I'm trying to read and research what it means to have Hashimotos and ways that I can help myself. I'm in pain most of the time, I'm often kept awake with muscle cramps and back pain, I get awful heartburn that often makes me sick, I'm forgetful, uncoordinated, I often get headaches and feel dizzy, im now at least 6 stone over weight, and I'm emotional and frustrated at feeling like this. I have forgotten what it's like to be normal. I feel isolated from the world. 🙇 Thank you for taking time to read my story, I'm sorry it's long. I'm sure that some of you will recognise the struggle, and hopefully share some thoughts to no only give myself but also others like me hope.😘 Laura\n",
      "Hi all I have had an underactive thyroid for 2 years and currently 21 weeks pregnant. I had a blood test on Monday and originally they only tested my t4 and t3 not my TSH but I pushed to get a TSH result but now I'm confused. My TSH level is 0.04 (0.4-3.00) which makes sense as I have had symptoms of over treatment (anxiety, unable to sleep, muscle weakness, fatigue and brain fog) but my T4 is 11.9 (5.8-20) and t3 4.9(3.8-6) so I'm confused. My doctor that I normally see is on holiday and the other doctor has said I'm slightly over treated but has not lower my thyroxine dose. Should I push for a dose reduction since I'm feeling so rubbish or could it just be pregnancy?\n",
      "Hoping someone can help/direct me. I've been on ndt for a few years now, Naturethroid, 3 pills a day. I think I need more but my doctor disagrees. I finally got him to perform tests other then tsh and these are the results: T4 free 0.54. Ref range 0.6-1.40 T3 free 3.20. Ref range 2.10-3.90 TPO antibody 939.00. Ref range 0-9.00 TSH 1.01. Ref range 0.44-4.21 The extremely high antibody has me worried, of course but I'm assuming it's Hashimoto's. Any advice? I've been feeling awful lately. Exhausted, can't loose weight, cold all the time, irritable, basically all known hypo symptoms. Do I ask for more Naturethroid? Add something else? I'm lost and the way I'm feeling isn't helping. Thank you\n",
      "I would appreciate any advice you can offer me. My thyroid problems began in early 80's when I gained 25 lbs in one month. Was diagnosed at that time as having Hypothyroidism and was put on Synthroid. Years later, a doctor told me he did not feel like I had a real thyroid problem and I was taken off of Synthroid. No thyroid medication for several years and everything was fine until I went on a diet to lose a few pounds for a high school reunion. Diet called for three tablets a day that would speed up metabolism. As bad as I wanted to shed pounds, I proceeded with caution and only took one tablet a day but followed the diet closely. Two weeks into the diet I felt like there was an elephant on my chest and I go to the ER. EKGS are fine but ER doc asked me if I have ever had any thyroid issues ? Thyroid tests abnormal and show Hypothyroidism again. Put back on thyroid medications and next testing results are normal. Pharmacist friend tells me he thinks high doses of Chromium Picolinate in the tablets set my thyroid off ? Ten + years later I am bit by a tick and contract Lyme disease. The doctor I end up seeing is one of the best infectious disease / Lyme disease specialists around and he has a bone density scanner in his office along with a nutritionist. He tells me my hips (bones) are very very thin for my age and he believes Synthroid is causing this thinning. I am put on a different T3 medication but can't remember which one. ***** For the record........every time I am put back on a thyroid medication or have been put on a new thyroid medication, my thyroid readings have gone back to normal range. Since 2004, I have been on two IV treatment programs that called for extremely high doses of antibiotics and other high dose medications for Lyme disease. Last long term IV program was in 2009 and I was on Liothyronine for my thyroid. At this time, my family doctor advises me that the IV medication will eventually destroy my thyroid. By the time 2012 arrives, I am out of funds and cannot afford to fly to Washington DC to see my Lyme disease specialist. For now, most treatments of long term Lyme are not covered by insurance companies so we pay out of our pocket for visits and treatment programs. As of 2013, seeing a new Lyme doctor and new family physician. Dealing with too many health issues to list but have also become gluten intolerant and weak immune system has left me allergic or sensitive to many things. By 2014, Lyme doctor wants me on a gluten free diet and tells me that my blood sugar is on the high side. New diet should be fruits, veggies, lean beef, fish, chicken. No gluten, sugar, caffeine, and only coconut oil for oils. All thyroid readings are in normal range at this time. Lyme doctor and family doctor has been monitoring my thyroid. I followed diet perfectly and was eating healthy vegetables, fruits, no sugars, using coconut oil for cooking and adding a few extra spoonfuls in hot tea. Also began to work-out with caution due to inflammatory issues. Two and a half months in, 15 pounds of weight loss. People at work tell me they see bald spots on my head. I have lost half of my hair and the texture has turned to straw. Thyroid results are abnormal and indicate Hypothyroidism......I am on Liothyronine 5mcg twice a day at this time. It was decided that I would try a drug with T3 and T4 and at my request I was put on Nature-throid. After 2 months on Nature-throid 65mg, bone pain is extreme. Hair is like straw and skin is very dry but hair starts to grow and eyebrows and eyelashes thicken. Weight loss continues but I don't feel good. Very nervous and wearing out quick during work outs. No stamina. Lyme doctor advises dose family doctor has me on is too high. By this time, I have a visit with an Endocrinologist. She agrees with Lyme doc and says main doctor has me on too high a dose of Nature-throid. Endocronologist says thyroid is just extremely sensitive to changes in diet, stress, medication, etc..... We cut back the Nature-throid to 47.5 mg and my eyebrows and eyelashes fall out. Bone pain stops. Skin texture a little better but still feels like sandpaper. It has been over one year since I have been on Nature-throid and have not had one normal test result. Lyme doc's opinion is to go back to square one and return to Liothyronine. Possibly increase dosage. Endocrinologist says: NO WAY. If anything I should be on T3 and T4 and she will never support T3 by itself because anyone that uses just T3 will have bone loss. Lyme doc says: NOT TRUE. This leaves me one confused patient. Advised both physicians that I would return to Liothyronine but not until after my daughter's wedding. Did not want to be the bald mother of the bride. This would be one month wait but I start to feel like someone has shoved a stick in my throat. Eye muscles feel so sore I think my eyes are going to fall out. Before leaving the state, Thyroid ultrasound is done and one side is definitely larger than the other side ? At this point, I had to attend wedding. One week later, I am back home and by (5/25) start back on Liothyronine 5mcg twice daily. Lyme doctor tells me to increase to 3 tablets instead of 2 a day but I wanted my thyroid tested first after going back to Liothyronine. Soon after returning to Liothyronine, knife feeling near thyroid gland has disappeared. Main doctor orders a CT scan. It comes back normal. Message left on my voicemail by main doctor's nurse: \" Your CT scan is normal and your thyroid results look good. Your T3 is high and your T4 is low but if you are feeling better... that is what counts.\" My weight loss is in limbo land. My sore eye muscles and the knife feeling in my throat is gone. This test run after approximately 6 weeks back on Liothyronine 5 mcg twice a day is as follows : T3 87-178 ng/dL 202 (HIGH) T3 FREE 2.5-3.9 pg/mL 3.9 T4 TOTAL 4.5-12.5 ug/dL 3.3 (LOW) T4 FREE 0.61-1.70 ng/dL 0.43 (LOW) TSH 0.35-5.00 ulU/mL 2.23 Many doctors do not want Lyme patients period because we are a COMPLEX bunch. I can't help but feel like I am not getting the best advice. I am also on disability now for Lyme disease. Begging someone to point me in the right direction. NEVER at any time has my thyroid problems affected my hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, skin, etc. Hair does not even grow anymore. Although Lyme disease can cause depression.....I think my thyroid is causing a lot of mental issues as well. Thanks in advance !\n",
      "Hello everyone, I recently went to see a primary care doctor about the pain in my neck. Ive been taking antithyroid meds for my Graves for (5 weeks I believe) and things have yet to improve (symptom wise, no bloodwork done) He scheduled an ultrasound and I just received the results * Large hypervascular nodule in the left lobe of thyroid. Large, complex area in the midpole measuring 1.9 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm *The right thyroid gland is heterogeneous. can anyone help interpret these? Thanks again everyone\n",
      "I have been on Levothyroxine for 1.5 months and didn't have any thyroid medication before. I have hashimotos so that is causing my thyroid not to work. I wish my doctor would investigate what caused the hashimotos but he seems to think it is not important. ANyway I am losing all my hair on levo it just started 3 weeks ago and my doctor didn't even care! I didn't have any hair loss before. He put me on 75 mcg so it may not even be the right dose. If I as much as touch my hair i have atleast 20 strands in my hair. I try to not shower as much but it is summer and it is hot so I kind of have to so I am not so gross. I am trying to switch doctors but they are booked for months. I want to just stop the meds but my doc told me I could go infertile not taking some medication. I am 25 I can't handle this. This medication hasn't help me at all I am more tired than before and I am experiencing joint pain which I never had before. The hair loss is making me so sad though. I don't know what to do. And my doc only focuses on T4 he told me T3 has no benefit. He is retarded. I got tested for my thyroid in may these are my levels free t4-.73 tsh- 9.588 total t4- 4.6 total t3- 87 Thyroid peroxidase abs- 8257.1 (1.0-60.0) I only had my free t3 tested once back in dec at a clinic and it was 2.7 and back then my free t4 was .9\n",
      "Hi there, I'm on 50mcg of levo and have been taking it for 4 years. My last results were: TSH 4.01 (0.3 4.2) FT4 17.3 (12 -22) I have been anxious and a bit stressy recently. My symptoms are: Bone and muscle ache. Especially in the joints. My legs feel heavy and tired. My hair is shedding, not bald but enough in the sink to realise it's coming out. I have an ache in my stomach. Mainly on the left side. I cannot tell if i'm hungry or not but it doesn't go away after I've eaten. I've also lost my appetite and constipated (unless i eat dairy, I'm lactose intolerant). I was ok until June and I think the reason is because I did a lot of exercise in April/May. I was part of a group at work trying to do the most distance within 6 weeks. I was walking 10-15 miles a day. After the challenge finished, I felt ok but didn't get any of the symptoms above until late June/July. Thanks, Martyn\n",
      "Hi All, I think I have been suffering with hypothyroidism for more than 14 years and was hoping for some insights regarding my test results (i have them going back to 2009) and history and wisdom or tips for going to talk to my Dr (again....) tomorrow. i have always been low or borderline - here are my lab tests in the range from 2009-2015 TSH 1.378-2.01 T3 2.8-3.22 T4 0.89 FT4 0.63-1.16 Thyroxine Binding Globulin 44 Every time I go to the Dr about my symptoms, they agree it sounds like classic hypothyroidism, they run the labs and then tell me it's not. Once, based on the thyroxine binding globulin test, I was referred to an endocrinologist, who didn't even discuss my results or symptoms, just gave me a lecture about healthy eating habits and Americans needing to lose weight etc. It was very strange. I am overweight, but not by more than 40-45 lbs. i am 180 and 5'5, and 35 years old. My symptoms include: fatigue - esp in the am, steady weight gain over last ten years, extremely difficult to lose weight, especially this past year or so, depression, constipation, cold hands and feet, insomnia, dry, rough skin, thick skin on heels, hair thinning/loss the past four years or so, very low heart rate, weakness and aches - esp. in the am, frequently low body temperature. Fogginess, trouble concentrating etc. I have also had thyroid nodules, which have since gone down. I was also diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago and have been on a pretty high dose of Aderall. Interestingly, despite the medications impact on my eating habits and acting as an appetite suppressor, I have lost no weight at all. My psychiatrist is dumbfounded - she said I'm the only patient she has ever had who has not lost weight on the drug and that usually she has to manage patients not losing too much weight. Additionally, the past three months I have been focused on feeling better and improving my physical health - I started eating a mostly vegan diet, low in fat and processed foods, running every other day, yoga, horse riding etc. This has made a big difference in my muscle tone etc, but again no real weight loss and if anything my symptoms above have intensified. Any input you can provide would be much appreciated - am I just imagining things? Any tips for speaking with the Dr. Why are they so reluctant to diagnose hypothyroidism/prescribe meds? I'm not one for rushing to the pill bottle overtime I have an ache or sneeze, but I'm frustrated at this point (and sad, when I went back through the medical records that I have available online from the past none years). I don't care about the lab results - I care about my symptoms and what they are telling us. Thanks in advance - Corgio\n",
      "Hi, just Got my test result with Tsh 13.5 T3 0.7 T4 81.2 I'm on 200mcg daily Had a complete thyroidotomy 7 years ago. I need help interpreting my situation. pls help.\n",

      "I stopped my birth control about seven months ago I was on it for about eight years. I also have hashimotos. After some research I am thinking that maybe my hair loss is due to me stopping my birth control and not due just to my thyroid medication (I take levothyroxine). I been on that for about 1.5 months. I was on sprintec up into end of december and I didn't really have any major symptoms after stopping besides more painful periods which I have always had before taking birth control. But as of recently these past three weeks my hair is falling out major! I actually counted how much I lost yesterday and it was over 200 strands not counting what I lost in the shower. I really didn't know I was losing that much I thought maybe less because I have thinner hair to begin with so without counting it, it doesn't look like that much but it really is. My concerns are is this from the birth control or also the thyroid medication because it is messing with my hormones. & if this is from birth control why has it taken so long after stopping for my hair to be falling out now and not months ago? Also, how can I gain my hair back? I am thinning so bad in the back of my head you see my scalp and I don't have a lot of hair to begin with. I am also 25 years old in good shape and eat well. I been taking evening primrose oil for two weeks so far but haven't seen a decrease in hair loss. I also take biotin and have taken biotin for about five years. If anyone has lost hair due to stopping birth control did it grow back? How long did it take for the hair loss to stop? Or anyone who stopped birth control and take any thyroid medications how was your hair while your hormone levels were being messed with and how long did it take for you to grow hair back? Any suggestions would be very helpful!

      "Hi, I am new to all this and was hoping someone could help. I had my bloods taken a few weeks ago and was told to have a re test in 3 months. I feel as if I've had symptoms of Hypo for several years. Tiredness, depression, weight gain, skin peeling, brain fog, sinus pressure etc. This morning I saw my doctor because of this pressure/tightening pain in my throat. I feel as if someone has their hand wrapped around it and gently squeezing. She then suggested I started on a low dose of Levothyroxine (25mg) I'm just a bit apprehensive about taking them. As she said that taking this medication could cause it to go the other way, where I could experience palpitations etc. (There is a lot of heart disease in my family) My results are .... Thyroxine 12.4 which she said is normal ... Thyroid Stimulating Hormone is 5.43 and she also said my Thyroid Antibodies are normal. Do you think these levels and my symptoms warrant this medication? Any advice will be appreciated Thank you.\n",
      "I'm 19 and 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, and was put on Levothyroxine. I'm currently on 100mg of thyroxine. I've never been overweight but I'm currently trying to cut my body fat and gain muscle tone. I recently calculated I'm only actually eating 1000 calories. Even if I have miss calculated this, I don't think I've miss calculated it by 500 odd calories. BUT I'm not losing weight, if anything I'm staying the same or looking a little 'fluffier'. 😐 I dont know how much I weigh, but the last time I did weigh myself I was 135 - 140lbs at 5'8\". Has anyone had any difficulty losing weight even with a seemingly medicated thyroid? And if so how did you get around it? Any advice would help so much ☺\n",
      "Hi, I had blood test about 2 weeks ago. Doctor said my thyroid level is high so she would like me to have another blood test after 2 months to determine if I have hyperthyroidism or not. I just would like to ask if these are symptoms of hyperthyroidism. I am sweating alot, having hot flashes randomly, having rapid heart rate (sometimes 80beats/min but sometimes 120 per min). I know that these are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, the weird thing is that I sweat a lot, but I feel cold and my body temperature is 96.6 which is lower than normal body temperature. Is that normal? And my joint hurts and I have severe headache. Sometimes my head sores (I do not know how to describe the pain, but my head feels so cold.) I am not sure if these are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. And if I have to take medications, are these symptoms going to disappear?? Please help.\n",

      "Based on results from blood tests, I am diagnosed with hypothyroidism. In March my measures were: T4 = 0.6, T3 = 2.4, TSH = 12.4. My doctor put me on thyroid grandular (and andernal glandular for stress) supplements. Each month my blood tests show \"improvement\". In June my measures were: T4 = 1.0, T3 = 2.5, TSH = 4.8. I have a small tumor that I want to treat naturally. In February, I went on a vegetarian diet and stopped cardio exercises. I unexpectedly lost 12 pounds in 1 month. I was a very \"fit\" person (triathlete). I had very low body fat to start with. Much of the 12 pounds lost was muscle mass. I realized I was eating too few calories. In response, I started increasing my calorie intake. I am now consuming 2,800 - 3,200 calories per day. I am exceeding macros and micros across the board. Yet, I am still losing a pound or so per week. I stopped taking the grandular supplements today hoping that my weight will stabilize. Regardless, what the heck is going on? Why am I losing weight while eating a lot of great food and still having mild hypothyroidism?\n",

      "Hello All...I was dx with Graves in 2011 and declared officially in remission this past January. Methimazole was stopped and all looked good. For the past two weeks I've had some post nasal drip, scratchy throat and pressure behind my eyes, all indicating a sinus infection. While this was going on I noticed my thyroid was slightly larger than normal and the post nasal drip seems to feel a little weird in my throat. Taking large bites of food also feels odd, almost as though something is in there. The weirdest part is my thyroid is of totally normal size first thing in the morning and seems to enlarge slightly by mid morning. Could it be caffeine? I know that sounds nuts but I'm at a loss as to why the gland feels swollen at different parts of the day. Let me add that I have absolutely no Graves or hyper symptoms at this time. I've scheduled an ultrasound and bloodwork for this coming week but was wondering if anyone has experience with this? Thank you.\n",
      "Hey Everyone! At the end of January, I had surgery to have a kidney stone removed. Since then, I've been feeling major fatigue, depression, frequent urination and aching legs. My doctor has run several blood tests and we found out that my parathyroid hormone is high (144) but my blood calcium is normal (8.7). I was sent in to have a parathyroid scan which showed no abnormalities on the parathyroid. Other \"abnormal\" blood tests results were low vitamin D (18) , high SED rate (29), high eosinophils (5.4%) and low red blood cell count (3.2). Blood tests were run again a month later and the results remained virtually unchanged. Although it appears nothing is extremely too high or too low, I'm still concerned. My doctor has referred me to an endocrinologist for further examination but I'm anxious while waiting for the referral to go through. Any ideas what could be going on?\n",

      "I had a yearly blood work done and got the following results. My Doctor said the TSH should be below 2. He did not say anything about the T3 or T4. TSH 2.36 Free T4 1.1 Free T3 2.8 I have lost about 80 pounds over the past nine years. Weight loss was due to grieving for husband that passed away, walking 2-3 miles a day and limiting junk food. I am 58 years old, 5'2\" and weigh 127 pounds. I have gained about 7 -10 pounds over the past year to 18 months. I am having a difficult time losing the weight. I would love to get back to 120. Doctor Suggested I go on a Nutrition Therapy that is given by IV to help me lose the weight.The injections would involve appetite suppressant, fat blocker and vietamins. I really don't want to do this because I feel like when I stop taking the injections which are very expensive, I will gain the weight back. My concern is that if it is my thyroid causing the weight gain and the thyroid is not treated will I gain the 80 pounds back? Do you think these levels warrant thyroid medication? Are they borderline or are these really bad numbers? What is considered normal thyroid level? Thanks\n",
      "Hi everyone, first post here so I will give a brief history. Diagnosed HypeR/Graves 3 years ago. After initial diagnosis and awaiting first Endo appointment, I was prescribed 40 mgs Carbimazole and some weeks later Carb was stopped as I had gone \"markedly\" HypOthyroid. At my first Endo appointment I was started on Block & Replace 40 mgs Carb and 75 micrograms Levo Thyroxine. I was on this treatment for almost 2 years until my GP stopped all medication to see how my thyroid reacted despite my pleas not to stop meds as I was having several symptoms including anxiety/palpitations/breathlessness and very tired and feeling quite cold - at this stage my TSH 5.15 (0.34 - 5.6) and FT4 13.4 (7.5 - 21.1). Within 10 days of meds being stopped ALL HypeR symptoms returned with a vengeance and my next blood test results were TSH 0.07 (0.34 - 5.5) Below Range and FT4 47.9 (7.5 - 21.1) Above Range. I was started on 40 mgs of Carb again and a few weeks later re-started Block & Replace. I NEVER felt very good on Block & Replace and have always had symptoms of anxiety/palpitations and breathlessness, at some stages not too bad but they have always been there but would also add that due to lack of cummunication between my Medical Practioners surgery and the Hospital Endo monitoring of my health/frequent blood tests has been extremely poor and in 2015 I only had ONE blood test. I am now on Carbimazole Titration (much to the annoyance of my Endo who has been pushing me for RAI, which I do not want). I have been on this treatment since April starting on 10 mgs Carbimazole which was then reduced to 5 mgs as blood results were showing over-medication:- 10th May -10 mgs Carb results:- TSH 13.21 FT4 10.4 FT3 5.6 17th May Carbimazole reduced to 5 mgs and blood test on 31st May results:- TSH 4.12 FT4 14.1 FT3 4.82 23rd June still on 5 mgs Carbimazole and blood results:- TSH 0.16 FT4 15.9 NO FT3 (?) Since the reduction in Carbimazole breathlessness has been getting progressively worse which in turn causes anxiety. When I rang this a.m. for my latest blood test results I was told by the secretary who gave them to me that a doctor had seen the results and had stated \"no further action required\" - I REALLY do not understand that statement as the TSH is BELOW RANGE on the scale used here. It has been suggested to me that I may have been kept on too high medication for too long. Any ideas very much appreciated. Christine\n",
      "I am a 33 year old female with a history of hypothyroid. I've been on levoxyl since I was 13 years old. I had a readjustment of the medicine back in January and all looked fine. Anyway I hit a crisis this past week. Looking back, things were getting out of hand but I did not identify that there WAS a problem or WHAT the problem was. I was moody - I thought I had PMS. I was tired - I thought I needed more rest etc. Anyway, over the past 2 weeks I crashed and burned. I was extremely tired and depressed and anxious, I could not sleep, I was so nervous that I had nausea and could not eat, I was moody and irritable, I developed a rash on my chest and eyelids, I had major brain fog (once I put my purse in my medicine cabinet...what?!?), exhausted but unable to get the sleep I needed due to anxiety and waking up, then over the past few days it got severe. I could not work because I was hysterical and in a full blown panic all day long (I cannot express the sheer terror I felt all day long) and I was laying on my bedroom floor sobbing and screaming and thinking I was going crazy. Then I got paranoid...I thought people had ulterior motives...that they didn't really want to help me, they wanted to lock me up or hurt me in some way. I ended up in the ER (my sheer terror and paranoia was so bad that I had to ask them to shut off the lights in the room and pull the curtain so I couldn't see out) and thank God for a good doctor who realized that I was not mentally ill but that this was my thyroid. They are adjusting my meds and I am following up with my PCP Monday (I got an emergency appt). They also gave me clonidine for the anxiety which, I must say, has helped a lot. Here are some tests which were done and am wondering if someone can shed some light? TSH - 17.37 T3 Free - 2.4 T4 Free - 1.0 Thyroglobulin Antibodies - 8 IU/mL (normal range is <1 IU/mL) Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies 13 IU/mL (normal range is <9 IU/mL ) What do these levels indicate? Hashimoto's? They are talking about a thyroid ultrasound...do they suspect cancer? Thanks. So glad to have found these boards. I thought I was going insane.....\n",

      "Hi everyone, Since I had my baby 3 months ago and probably during pregnancy I have been having hypothyroid symptoms that have progressively been getting worse. Some days I am not even functional. I have extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, hard to take a breath (feels like something is blocking airway), constipated, cold intolerance but mostly heat intolerance and sweating with hot flashes, joint pain, dry skin that then gets oily and the list goes on. My mom has hashimotos and hers got so bad before diagnosis that she started blacking out. I would rather not get to that point. I requested a full thyroid panel from my doctor and thankfully he listened but still thinks I'm ok because everything is \"normal\" Thankfully he is listening to my symptoms and precribed 25 mcg of synthroid (although I'm not sure if it's way too low?) Here are my lab results: TSH 3.14 taken around 2pm normal is .30-4.00 mIU/L I've had other TSH done and they have been 3.3 and 3.75 (all in the afternoon ) Free T4 13 norm 9-23 pmol/L Free T3 4.2 norm 3.5-6.5 pmol/L Thyroglobulin antibody 15 normal <40 kIU/L Thyroperoxidase antibody 13 norm <35 kIU/L Like everyone else, I just want to feel better asap but I know this is going to be a long journey. It's hard getting someone to listen and treat what they think are in the normal range for fear of turning me hyper. Does this look like Hasimotos? Is 25mcg enough? I feel like he gave me that dose just to appease me. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!\n",
      "Had few episodes of passing out & tachycardia (had tachycardia all my life). Emergency room docs told me I was hyperthyroid since my TSH was .2 I tried explaining it is suppressed from my meds. They didn't palpate my neck nor order any test other than TSH and reg. heart test. They kept me in for two days and release me with a new script of Synthroid .0075mcg. I was on 130 grains Naturethroid. They also put me on beta blockers for my tachycardia. I must say I like not feeling my heart beating strong in my chest. So will probably keep the beta blocker, 25 mg. twice a day and ask my reg. thyroid doc. what she thinks when she gets back from a summer trip. When I was released from the hospital I didn't take the Synthroid, I continued taking Nature Thyroid. I ordered a thyroid scan and it came back that remaining thyroid globe is shrinking considerably. I lost the other one 10 years ago- 4.5 cm multi-nodular goiter. I ordered FT3's and FT4's, and antibodies. My antibodies are less than 1. My FT3's and FT4's are way low, barely at the bottom of the range. The endo who saw me at the hospital wants me to make an apt. with her, but I'd rather wait until my doc returns. As hospital doc says I'm hyper and my doc. believes I'm hypo. Guess I'm looking for feedback that I'm hypo and not hyper. From scanning the internet, I also wonder if this was a thyroid crisis. Is a shrinking gland normal and are my FT's way off?\n",

I asked my doc for a thyroid test, and she of course only did the TSH. This came back well within the \"normal\" range at 2.1 (lab range = .4-4.7). After the nurse tried to tell me that this result proved that my thyroid was completely fine, i insisted that i would not take this one limited test as the be-all, end-all test for thyroid problems. Doc then ordered 2 more tests, one of which was free T4 which came back at 1.1, again within normal range (lab = .7-1.9). I am still waiting on the 3rd test, which i am not even sure what it was.

I do get a \"lump in my throat\" feeling sometimes, but have always assumed it was due to my acid reflux. Is it possible, with my tests in the normal range, to still have something going on with my thyroid i should add that i have had stomach issues for about 11 years. When i went gluten free in 2013, i felt really great for about 8 months, stomach pains, gas, headaches, all went away, then slowly started creeping back in. Doctors always say \"well you probably had too much dairy, or accidentally had gluten\". The gas lately, and stomach issues again are starting to become an issue. And headaches again. Any suggestions, or ideas?????\n",
      "In March my doctor ran some generic blood work on a regular work-up. My TSH came back with a reading of 0.03. She sent me back for repeat blood work in case of lab error and to check my T3 and T4 and referred me to an endo. Those results came back a week later: TSH 0.04 Free T4 13 Free T3 4.7 The endo thought it could be some subclinical hyperthyroidism, she didn't want to treat me with any medication because my T4 and T3 were normal. But she sent me away with a requisition to redo my blood work in 3 months. I went this week and my results came back: TSH 4.98 Free T4 12 Free T3 5.4 Why? My T4 and T3 seem so consistent with the previous blood work but is it normal for my TSH to go from being SO low to being high in less than a 3 month span? Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks!\n",
      "I am struggling with a thyroid problem. I went to my doctor last week because I have had a high heart rate betweem 120-140 for months for and wanted to have it checked. My ecg was normal aside from tachycardia. The dr told me to take 81 mg aspirin daily until they find out what it is. The doctor's office also took some blood to run tests. When asking about family history I told the doctor that my mom has hyperthyroidism and she checked my neck and said it felt enlarged. The next day I got a call saying that a simple test they ran showed something with my thyroid being 0.005. I'm assuming that's my t4. (I've probably researched it way too much in the past week anf my mom has hyperthyroidism.) They told me that they were going to have the lab do more extensive tests. I received another phone call the following week confirming that I had abnormal test results. I have a followup next week to go over my labs. I don't even know what exactly is wrong. (Hypo or hyper?) Not having an appointment until next week is starting to stress me out. I guess my real question is how do you deal with something like this? I'm 28 and have never had any medical problems except for having my tonsils and adenoids removed when I was 20. I'm really struggling with this emotionally because everyone seems to think it is okay to to just go on medication but I don't. I know I have to suck it up but that's the struggle I'm having. I know about thyroid storm etc and it sounds horrible. I've also read that by taking anyithyroid medication that it can make you hypo. Is that true? Is that permanent? Will it eventually fix itself and go away or is it permanent? Any answers would be great. Thanks!\n",

Hopefully someone can help, Thanks https://i.imgsafe.org/f40a37cd5c.jpg edit: Hello again, I received this message from someone who looked at the scan. They said the following \"The scan shows asymmetrically increased uptake in the thyroid. This can represent an active nodule\" Can anyone elaborate on what this could mean? I asked the person who said this but a reply is requiring a $99 consult fee per question. Seems steep to me. EDIT: I take it that I may be in the wrong section.

      "Good Morning, I am new to this thyroid business 2 weeks ago I felt a large lump in my throat. I went to the doctor the next day and he said the left lobe of my thyroid was enlarged. He did bloodwork and sent me for an ultrasound. My bloodwork was normal. However, my u/s results showed a very large complex nodule in my thyroid. Now, I just lost 20 pounds (by dieting) and I never felt the lump before. I did notice the past year or saw a weird feeling in my throat while lying down or when I put my chin down. My doctor is sending me to an endocrinologist. I have an appointment the 21 of June. I am trying to make sense of my u/s report. Is anyone able to decipher it? Findings: Right Lobe - Measures 6.1 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm. Heterogenous echotexture, normal vascularity. Nodules: Midpole nodule, solid 6 x 2 mm Left Lobe - Measures 7.1 x 3.1 x 3.9 cm. Heterogenous echotexture, normal vascularity. Nodules: Complex nodule occupying most of the left lobe 5.3 x 31 x 3.7 cm. The nodule contains solid and cystic components. The nodule is hypervascular. Isthmus - Measures 0.15 cm. Normal echotexture and flow. Nodules : None Other findings : None Impressions: 1. Dominant nodule/mass occuping most of the left thyroid lobe. Based on size and cystic components follow-up recommended 1. Diagnostic recommendations - Radionuclide scan. Fine needle aspitation strongly recommended. So I have a huge nodule in my left thyroid. I am sure one way or the otherit has to come out. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!\n",
      "Hello, everyone. I am a 28-year-old male diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease in January. My TSH has consistently come in borderline high (around 3.3), but I am positive for TPO antibodies and have many of the classic symptoms of hypothyroidism.

Im 28 and have had symptoms of hyperthyroid all of my life including anxiety/nervousness, excessive sweating, rapid increase in heart rate when nervous or doing physical activity, hand tremor, heat intolerance, fatigue, and have always been skinny despite eating a lot. My mom had her thyroid removed when she was young due to similar problems and goiter/tumor so I finally decided to get some blood work done.

      "Hello! I have been on Armour Thyroid for a little over a year now. I was started out at just 7.5 mg, then to 15 mg four months later. I am 73 years old and had developed heart palpitations on Levothyroxine after six months, so switched to Armour and had to take Propranolol for eight months. I was weaned off the beta blocker at the end of January. My treatment began in November 2014, so I'm still a relative newbie. My November 2015 lab results on 15 mg Armour were: TSH 2.790 (0.340-4.820); free T4 0.80 (0.54-1.17); and free T3 (1.5-4.1). I felt good on that, even though some might say my TSH was too high, but when It was down to 1.2 on Levothyroxine, my free T4 went over the top and the heart palpitations began. My May 2016 lab results on the same dosage of Armour have just come in over a holiday weekend, so I can't talk to my doctor until Tuesday. Here they are, with the same reference ranges as above: TSH 3.590; free T4 0.81; free T3 4.0. My TSH is definitely too high for comfort. I'm starting to nod off while watching even the most suspenseful program on TV, for example. I think I need more Armour, but what will happen to the free T3 if my dosage is increased? It's already almost over the top. Also, I have had the odd heart flutter over the past six weeks. They're barely perceptible and only happen once in a while. It's not anywhere as bad as the heart palpitations on Levothyroxine and doesn't make me feel sick. I was diagnosed as a low risk for a heart attack last year (treadmill + before and after multiple images of my heart), but these flutters are unnerving! This most recent lab test was taken at 2 p.m. The earlier test was taken in the morning after fasting (part of my yearly exam). I don't know how much difference that would make in the results. Thanks.\n",

      "Since Cytomel is a fast-acting thyroid drug & has a relatively short half-life, how long does it take before a change in your T3 level is reflected in your lab results? I know that you have to be on a new Synthroid dosage for several months before your dose can be adequately assessed as being correct or in need of increases or decreases? Does it take a similar period of time after a Cytomel change to assess this or does the fast-acting/short half-life nature of the drug reduce the amount of time needed to assess the adequacy of current dosage?? My Cytomel was increased a month ago since my level was roughly half of where I'm targeted to be. My anti-TPO antibodies also DOUBLED since the last labs. She increased my Cytomel by 5 mcg but I didn't feel that usual \"boost\" I get with a dose increase & I'm still having the same symptoms & the same INTENSITY of symptoms, so I would like to add ANOTHER 5mcg. My doc, however, wants me to wait another TWO MONTHS to repeat the labs & assess dosing. I work on my feet 14-16 hrs a day & the horrible burning, tingling & just all-out pain that I'm having in my feet is making my work days a living hell & my nights sleepless. I've managed only 2-3 hours of sleep each night for the last 2 weeks because the extreme burning in my feet keeps me awake. I don't know that I can wait another 2 months for relief.\n",
      "I have been taking a synthroid 112 mcg for almost 10 years. Recently, I went to my endocrinologist looking for a solution to my fatigue and inability to lose weight. She suggested I add Cytomel 5mg twice a day in addition to taking synthroid. Doing this made me feel extremely weird- crazy head fog, unable to focus clearly, anxiety off the charts, and more fatigue than I already felt. I stopped the Cytomel after one week of taking it- fast forward 3 weeks and all symptoms have gone say except for the head fog, inability to focus, and extreme fatigue. This in turn has made me depressed and unmotivated. Can anyone help explain what's going on? I'm leaning towards adrenal fatigue since I drink a fair amount of caffeine per day. Please help! I did not feel like this until I took Cytomel. Other information about my health- eat healthy, I work out, plenty of water, minimal alcohol.\n",

      "Hello! Just joined the forum, knowing that there are so many people willing to help having all sort of conditions, I hope this would help me towards the diagnosis of my mesh of conditions. I had to erase a long post to summarize things. I hope someone would share their knowledge to help me out. Having a little fat tummy and fatty liver, I decided to take less food and ride a stationary cycle for around 30 mins (sometimes 40-50 sometimes 25-20) for 2-3 weeks with low fat diet (no meat, minimal oily fried food, chicken, grains,whole grain wheat etc). That trimmed my tummy down but my arms/legs muscles began to shrink. I started to have constant twitching in arms, legs, face followed by pin-pricking burning sensation all over the legs/feet/arms along with mini-cramps (painless but muscles feels stretched - enough to wake me up from sleep at couple of nights - in arms/legs/chest/face/fingers), followed by the discomfort in throat not letting me swallow anything. On googling symptoms, deadly nervous system diseases showed up (from Parkinsons to ALS/MS). Could it be that serious? or its just a deficiency of something? I did went to the doctor yesterday and he prescribed me an anti-biotic for throat infection, panadol for my spasms/pain and Ensure supplement as he told me that is deficiency as I never took proper nutrition and I lack Calcium etc.. He also asked me to drink milk twice a day (never did any test though). Throat seems bit better now, hopefully it will be fine after the completion of anti-biotic days. I don't have any changes in speech, apart for minor discomfort of the finger muscles pull, I can move them freely. I played badminton, did hike without any issue. (although pins and needles + twitches/cramps return after each activity). The only thing apart from twitches/mini-cramps worries me is that in last 7 days, I had two 2-3 hours attacks of feeling heavy-headed, like someone pulling me down with much difficult to move (although I don't fell, I feel like I would and I felt like putting my head down instead lying down). They came and went on their own (or the panadol kicked in). What do you think? can it be something serious? I am unemployed (aged 26/27, non-smoker, non-alcoholic), and in an under-developed country, medical facilities aren't that good. I haven't seen anyone mentioning ALS/MS here. Got one of my uncle diagnosed with Parkinson though. And since my family got anxiety issues, I don't want to put them into such worry, so I can't goto a neurologist unless its of absolute necessity as it would made my anxiety-hit family members more panicked. I hope people with such diseases and few with medical knowledge can guide me.\n",
      "Hi everyone, I currently don't have any serious thyroid issues. I have been seeing an endocrinologist off and on for the last 5 years (starting at age 16), a doctor suggested it as my thyroid appeared enlarged. Blood tests reveal all my thyroid levels are normal except my TSH which is usually on the low side (0.29-0.39). Recently my normal endocrinologist has quit so I am left seeing a Nurse Practitioner who I do not feel very confident in.

I have also been on BC for the last 6 years and have been very regular until the last 6 months, in which I have worse PMS symptoms and break through bleeding.

Left lobe measures 6.3 x 1.4 x 2.3 cm. Isthmus measures 5 mm. Right lobe volume 12.8 cc. Left lobe volume 10.2 cc. Overall size of the gland has not changed significantly. There is normal Doppler flow to the gland. The upper pole of the right lobe there is a hypoechoic nodule measuring 11 x 8 x 11 mm. Containing low-level echoes but there appears to be some through transmission is consistent with complex cyst, no significant change. In the lateral mid right lobe there is a 7 x 4 x 6 mm cystic nodule that is not significantly changed. In the lower pole there is a heterogeneous slightly hypoechoic solid-appearing nodule measuring 7 x 4 x 4 mm. A similar-appearing nodule is seen on prior study. In the upper pole of the left lobe there is a hypoechoic slightly hypoechoic solid nodule measuring 11 x 6 x 12 mm. Similar nodule seen previously. In the mid left lobe there is a predominantly solid nodule with small cystic components measuring 10 x 4 x 5 mm. This is unchanged. In the lower pole there is a cyst measuring 11 x 9 x 7 mm. Similar lesions previously.\" Please any input will help, I'm sick of doctors saying since I'm young I don't need to worry about anything.\n",

All the other thyroid hormones were normal, T4, FT3, TSH, antibodies...everything was normal, so the doc made me run lots of test from head to toes, but they found nothing...after a couple of month I started feeling a bit better, but still not at 100%...Lately, about three months ago the symptoms came back stronger but in addition, my muscles hurt all the time, especially the muscles around my neck, shoulders, traps...I wake up everyday as if I did some strenuous labor work the previous day... After more tests, the results were exactly the same, mildly low T3, high creatine kinase, everything else normal...Symptoms includes: Muscles pain, general weakness, sometimes dizziness, tight throat, massive headaches especially after eating, fatigue, restlessness, irritable...The doc has no idea what's wrong with me...I've been experimenting with my diet, with no success.

      "Hi everyone-- In February I had some blood tests done. The TSH came back 4.40. The doctor had me take the FT4 test, which came back normal range 1.3. He said that I was OK. At the time I had just quit smoking (like, a week and a half before), and I've read this can skew results on thyroid readings. I was also fairly sick and would remain so for another month+. I'm better now, but have some lingering symptoms, including a strange warmth exuding from my palms and feet. The funny thing is, the 'warmth' just feels warm and sometimes tingly; my hands themselves aren't warm. I've read this can be a possible symptom of thyroid disorder. My sleep has also become off; I now wake up at 4:30 - 5 every morning, whether I want to or not (I used to sleep until 7). My question... with these readings, should I go in for another thyroid test? Should I wait a little longer? I haven't smoked in almost 4 months. Would this tingly/warm sensation be part of a growing thyroid issue? It's been fairly persistent for these last few months and is annoying... not painful, just annoying. edit: no hair loss, no weight gain (in fact, while I was sick I lost 20+ pounds), I'm otherwise healthy. I have fatigue, but I'm also a schoolteacher\n",

      "Hi. I had some bloodwork done this week (didn't even know it was also checking thyroid, was concerned about blood sugar levels, which were fine). Nurse called me the next day saying my cholesterol was high, 258 with ratio of 2.5 so low risk, and that my TSH was 6.4. Hypothyroid. I was a bit surprised and have a few questions please. 1. I had just completed a 2 week course of Prednisone two weeks prior to the blood test. Could that have affected my results? 2. I went in for bloodwork because for the last few months I have been having practically nonstop palpitations/skipped beats and lots of trouble breathing (thus the steroid treatment). I don't see these things listed as symptoms of hypothyroidism, has anyone else experienced this? 3. I have had no weight gain (I've lost some though), no hair loss, no unusually dry skin or constipation that is not normal for me. I *have* had lots of anxiety, jittery feeling, trouble sleeping. I would think I would be hyper not hypo going by my symptoms. Anyway, the nurse phoned in a script for synthroid 75 mcg and told me to have blood rechecked in 2 months. That's it? No exam, no further tests and starting me off at 75 mcg when most posts I read talk about starting at a lower dose first? Is this right? I am thinking about seeing another dr. for more complete workup before starting meds (and that 2nd test to make sure steroids didn't affect the TSH levels) Thanks for reading all of this! I am just so stressed already by the palps and breathing issues. Oh, and I'm on warfarin, so that's another thing to deal with. I am 52 btw. Judy\n",
