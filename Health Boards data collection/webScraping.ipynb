    "### Scraping Health Board's Posts and Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on extracting posts and articles from Health Board forums using web scraping techniques. Health Board is a platform with a wealth of user-generated content on various health topics, making it an excellent resource for applications such as sentiment analysis, trend monitoring, and topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Retrieve posts and articles from specific health-related categories on Health Board based on topic criteria (e.g., mental health, fitness).\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.\n",
    "- **Data Storage**: Store the scraped data in a structured format, such as CSV or a database, for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools and Technologies\n",
    "- **Python**: The primary programming language for web scraping.\n",
    "- **Beautiful Soup**: A library for parsing HTML and extracting data.\n",
    "- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests to access web pages.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: A data manipulation library to handle and analyze the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "1. **Set Up the Environment**: Install the necessary libraries using pip.\n",
    "2. **Define Scraping Logic**: Write functions to scrape data from specific health categories on Health Board.\n",
    "3. **Run the Scraper**: Execute the scraping script and monitor the data collection process.\n",
    "4. **Analyze the Data**: Use Pandas to analyze the collected posts and articles for insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "This project serves as a practical introduction to web scraping and data analysis using Python, providing valuable experience in handling real-world data from an online health community.\n"

      "had half of thyroid out 19 years ago, multinodular goiter. have antibodies for hashimotos quit smoking in Feb, now my thyroid went the other way, TSH is .01, and FT3 is elevated. I believe my multinodular goiter is now toxic. seeing endo next week and ENT next month. i'm concerned because my heartbeat is very noticeable after i go up 3 flights of stairs. i have extreme fatigue. I hope I will be ok in the meantime until we get this sorted out\n",
      "I am posting this question for my husband. 2 Yrs ago, he had a bad accident at work where he almost lost his leg. 9 \"Leg salvage\" surgeries where a muscle &amp; artery was taken from upper thigh &amp; sewn in lower leg, tibia nail, screws, skin flap, bone graft, he now has drop foot and our biggest fear is his coming down with Diabetes with his LEG LIKE THIS. It's basically a \"Frankenstein\" leg now. He recently had Blood work (will see Doc in 2 weeks) his TSH was 7.740 - this is Subclinical Hypothyroidism as I have been reading, he wants him to start on the 25mcg of Levothyroxine. I've been reading how taking these meds RAISES BLOOD SUGAR, his Sugar is always around 107 -115 when getting blood tests, so he is teetering towards Type 2. Thankfully his health was good enough when he had the accident, his leg healed without problems... Anyone here who got Type 2 after starting Thyroid Meds. Should we be worried , is there anyway to fix this would out starting the Thyroid Hormone, as once you start, there is no going back, right? Its possible his iodine level may be lower as I don't cook with much salt... not sure he was tested for Iodine. We try to limit that so his blood pressure won't go up.. If you do one thing, it causes problems with another!! Getting older sucks. He is 60 yrs old, he is not overweight, but a thin man approx 155 lbs/ 5'9 . Thank you\n",
      "33F/Utah Help Understanding Test Reults I am a 33F from UT that has been experiencing severe fatigue, bad joint and muscle pain and just overall feeling crappy. 5 feet 5 in 180lbs I am on Lexapro, Procare Vitamin with 45mg iron, Blood pressure meds only major surgery was a gastric bypass. I have had iron anemia since I was a teen. My doctor(GP) and endocrinologist have run several tests to try to figure out whats going on but they seem to disagree with each other. My primary doctor thinks that it's secondary hyperparathyroidism due to calcium deficiency but the endocrinologist thinks it's primary so they ran a bunch of additional blood work to try to determine it but the results are very confusing to me because they're conflicting what they said they were looking for. Can anyone help interpet these ? Calcium, Ionized 1.17 Albumin 4.3 Sodium 135 Potassium 4.2 CO2 21 Calcium 9.0 Phosphorus 4.2 Iron 169 Iron Saturation 54 TBIC 315 RBC 5.06 RDW 12.2 Lymphocytes Absolute 3.31 24 HR URINE CALCIUM 293 I'm trying to understand what all these mean and my GP originally prescribed calcium citrate twice a day but it was making my symptoms worse and my fatigue was really bad so he had me stop to run more tests. I was only on it for 3 days. My GP said primary and secondary are treated differently so they have to determine which one before I move forward but I'm in a lot of pain that's just getting worse.\n",
      "I had been taking levothyroxine 0.88 mg at a stable dose for over a year, but on May 30, my TSH jumped up to 10.99. My doctor then increased my dose to 1.12 mg. I just had labs done on Thursday, and now my TSH is 13.16! My T3 is 96 ng/dl and my free T4 is 0.77 ng/dl. How can TSH be so high while T3 and T4 are in the normal range? How is it possible that I need another dosage increase so soon? I do have a subclinical Epstein-Barr infection, but I am taking turmeric to manage inflammation. I have been very tired and have been gaining weight.\n",
      "Has anyone experienced an elevated paraythyroid level while receiving prolia injection at six-month intervals. I started prolia this year in January with a normal PTH level - now it is showing at 169 on recent blood work.

      "My mother is a 58-year-old Pakistani woman who underwent full thyroid removal surgery in 2021. Following the procedure, she began experiencing a burning sensation in her body, particularly in her feet and head. Additionally, she has been dealing with digestive problems and skin allergies called Urticaria since 2019. While she has been managing her skin allergies through medication and avoiding certain foods, the burning sensation has become increasingly painful since the surgery. As a result, she has been struggling with depression and difficulty sleeping due to her health issues. Despite seeing numerous doctors and trying various medications, she has found little relief. She has also noticed that some medications exacerbate the burning sensation. On days when her skin allergies are severe, she feels less or no burning sensation, but the allergies make her daily life more challenging. Conversely, on days when the burning sensation is more intense, especially in her head, she has fewer or no allergies. Recently, her burning sensation has become even more severe, to the point where it causes her to cry. The medication that used to alleviate her symptoms is no longer effective. She describes the burning sensation as feeling like \"strong acid running through my entire body, especially in my head.\" We are seeking your medical advice and treatment recommendations for her condition. Currently, she is taking the following medications: For stomach: Bifasic 60mg Cap (DEXLANSOPRAZOLE); Kiride (Levosulpiride 50mg/capsule) For sleep: Relaxin 3mg For Urticaria Skin Allergy: Tekostine (Ebastine) 10mg For thyroid: Thyroxine 50mcg For blood pressure: Exval-A (Amlodipine / Valsar: 5m/160m)\n",
      "I have all the symptoms of Hasimotos my brother has it my aunts, dad, and cousins. I have been feeling horrible, so I asked for them to do the testing for my annual. This is what it said T3-2.56, T4-1.05, and TSH-.80 these are lower than last year I am not sure what to make of this, but I am hoping for some guidance. I am tired of feeling this way.\n",
      "I have been living with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis for almost 30 years. I have never lost weight while being treated and have steadily climbed to 232 lbs! There is no sign of anything else for me except the above. No cortisol issues or Addisons. Just fat. Assure from a dying metabolism- I also experience different reactions from the different medications and at the moment don’t know what to do. Armour Naturthroid make me feel good except for hot spots of incessant itching. Cytomel with Levothyroxine swelling and water retention - hands and feet. Same for Tirosint. Any Synthroid other than to 50mcg make me itch. Is there anything else I can take or ask for to just feel good, stop the growth of my body, and not have to scratch parts of my skin off!\n",
      "Been dealing with this for over a year. My ferritin is low, my thyroid is low, but here’s the fun: when I take iron for a while to raise my levels, one day I’ll get a sudden rise in heartbeat from 77 to 170 within a minute. After I deal with that for a while, it calms down and then I get tremors for a half hour. Then I have to back off the iron or it happens again. Getting more tests soon, but has anyone else been through this? What did you do to solve it?\n",

Right lobe a nodule was found 1.1x0.7x0.9 cm Solid relatively echogenic to isoechoic wider then taller and smoothly marginated. Tirad 3 . Should I call and tell them I want to check to see if any changes or wait a year this is my regular md?? Thanks a tad bit nervous\n",
      "Hello my name is Tesker, if you are reading this thank you for taking the time to listen to my life's story. This is going to be a long post because honestly at the moment I don't have anyone to talk to and I need to let it all out. Well I don't know where to start so I guess I'll just start with what happened about 5 hrs ago. Sadly the woman that I deeply love and have been loyal and in love with for 13 yrs, have two kids together and have been engaged for about a year now, stuck out her hand grabbed her engagement ring and told me that she can't do this anymore.....meaning us being together. I can't even describe to you the amount of sadness that I am feeling right now. I am so deeply in love with her but it's come to the point where I don't know who she is anymore. She used to be this sweet, loving, caring person that treated me with so much respect. We were unseperable. Before we became Bf and Gf I had to meet her 2 kids (Son 8yrs and daughter 2yrs. It wasent that long after where they both decided to call me dad. We were a happy family of four. About 2yrs together things started to get weird. My Gf started to get upset and irritable when me and my son would hang out together. We thought it was just jealousy but it started to get real violent. She would scream and yell at me just because me and my son would have fun together. She would get into these ridiculous rages. She realized that she would get upset for no reason and would be sorry. Being tired of feeling finally went to her doctor and eventually was told that she had hypothyroidism. Threw out eight years we had our meny moments of arguments. She would argue with me about everything. According to her she was never at fault. I honestly never liked to argue with her because it always turns out to be a three day argument. From the research that I learned about hypo I new that she wasent her self and COULDENT be upset with her. But some arguments were so obviously all in her head that I couldent help myself from not losing my cool which made things worse. We broke up around 4 times all over pointless things. But things got a whole lot worse about 5 yrs back when our oldest son was shot and killed at work. It devastated all of us but especially her. Because of that she got in a state of depression that she developed Broken heart Syndrome which caused her to now suffer with Chronic Heart Failure. She now has a hard time catching her breath. Did I mention she also suffers from sleep apnea. Yes at night as she sleeps she sometimes stops breathing. With her constant mood swings, her depression over the loss of my son, dealing with her chronic heart failure she isent the same person anymore. All she does is argue with me about anything. Why I came home late from work. Why I left the mess in the kitchen, I mean she still argues with me about me supposably losing the house keys three yrs ago when there was no proof. I have been slowly losing the girl that I fell in love with due to hypothyroidism. This last argument that we just had had to be the worst one out of them all. While I was asleep I was dreaming that she had died. I saw both of my kids weeping and shouting for their mom to wake up. I was holding her yelling for her to wake up. I eventually woke my self up screaming babe and when I saw her laying there with her eyes closed I started crying. She quickly woke up and I cried even deeper happy that she was alive. I never cried the way I cried at that moment. What started the argument was that at the time in my worst after I told her what I have just dreamed she without any kind of sympathy or compaction just told me \" It's just a dream\" and effortlessly put her one arm around me and repeated \"I'm here it's just a dream\" and then went back to sleep. I was so hurt and upset that I got up and went to the restroom. I could not stop crying . Uncontrollable crying. Then when I got out of the bathroom she was now awake and as I sat next to her all she was talking about was about mail that was sent to us by mistake. I felt so hurt that she still did not show me any kind of comfort especially because it was about losing her something that I worry about all the time. I mentioned to her that I felt that she was rude and inconsiderate towards my feelings and she went off on me. She was so offended that she put out her hand and grabbed her ring and said to me \" I can't do this anymore \" ant took off her engagement ring and gave it back to me . It feels like the end. I feel hopeless in everything that I try to do for her. I always keep in mind that she has medical issues and I shouldn't blame her for anything. She doesn't want to talk. She doesn't want to ever discuss her condition. Just always wants to argue. Well that was my story. Thanks for those who took the time to read it. I'm not sure what I am going to do but I'm am just going to pray to God and hope for the best.\n",
      "Hello! I have been on a very low sodium diet (< than 1000 mgs a day) for about 8 years due to meniere's disease. I don't add salt to my food at all and omit salt from my baking. In addition I eat very little dairy food and/or sea food, both of which are major sources of iodine. I eat very little processed food. I never knew there was a connection between low sodium diets and hypothyroidism until I started googling for reasons as to why I have lost so much hair in the last couple of years, then I find low sodium diets can cause iodine deficiency which in turn can cause hypothyroidism. My TSH level is checked every year at my annual physical and is always \"normal.\" It has been going up steadily though and in April it was 2.2. Last time the Free T4 was checked was in 2012 and at that time it was .79. Because these are \"normal\" my doctor won't do any more testing. In addition to the hair loss I have several symptoms - high total cholesterol and LDL (trigs and HDL are excellent) despite eating ALL of the right food, none of the wrong and walking daily, exhaustion/fatigue, slowness of movement, depression, cramping in legs and feet, constipation, no motivation to do anything, can't concentrate. Strangely I have 1 symptom usually attributed to hyperthyroidism - terrible insomnia (no problem falling asleep but wake several times in the night), I probably average 3-6 hours of sleep at best. Also I am not obese and actually have lost a bit of weight lately as I gave up my daily muffin and granola, hoping to bring my cholesterol down (brought it down a whopping two points!) Anyone have any experience with iodine deficiency and hypo? Does it sound like I could have hypo? With my doctor unwilling to do any further testing I'm not sure what to do - just live with it and accept that I'm getting older as he tells me to do? I'm 63 and other than this and celiac I'm in pretty darn good health, but it's starting to make me feel very old. I know I could add more iodine to my diet to see how it makes me feel but before I do that I really would like to know for sure if this is my problem.\n",
      "32 Hi all Haven't been on here in a very long time. I had my thyroid removed many many years ago. I have been on Levothyroxine. 'But, am not sure what time to take it. You can't have calcium or iron within 4 hours of taking the Levothyroxine. I've been taking at about 3 or 4 in the morning. Many many times I can't fall back asleep. I sleep only like 1 1/2 hours at a time. If I were to take it when I get up at about 6:30 am then I wouldn't be able to eat till about 10:30. I can't eat my cereal with water, etc. I need some advice. Thanks\n",
      "I will be getting all the tests tomorrow but this one confuses me. I have been treated for hypo (Levothyroxine 137mg daily) But lately, my heart rate is much higher (99-120) palpitations constantly, and extreme exhaustion. My sleep used to be fantastic and now I'm getting about half of what I used to. Lost 7 pounds without trying. Is this hyper now? Do I need less Levothyroxine?\n",
      "Wow long time since I've been here! TT in 2006, could never tolerate any amount of T3, survived on levoxyl until menopause hit. Now, mysteriously, I can take Armour to a certain point. I'm on 2 grains (120 mgs) and very tired. I recently took 135 mgs of armour for 2 months, and I got very anxious/depressed and my hair started falling out. My labs showed low free t4, low free t3 and, of course, no TSH. I increased to 150 mg and in a week I was almost hospitalized with hyper symptoms. Never again. When I reduced to 120 mg those symptoms subsided and I even lost a little weight - go figure. But I get so tired that I'm afraid I'm going to pass out behind the wheel. Today I started on a combination of 120 mg (2 grains) Armour and 25 mcg Levoxyl - anybody else combining like this? I'm hoping it works as I can't seem to tolerate any more T3. Cheers!\n",
      "I have hashi's and have been on levothyroxine for several years and after speaking with others about the importance of antibodies got tested and even though not extremely elevated, the antibodies are elevated. I am waiting to switch over to Armour but am waiting for the Doctor to call. In the meantime, I have shortness of breath that is constant with chest tightness. I was diagnosed with mild persistent asthma last year but the albuterol and qvar are no longer helping. I have read where others have had shortness of breath but only with exercise.

      "Hello! I recently received test results for my thyroid which indicated that I was extremely hypothyroid and had Hashimoto's. TSH was crazy high at 26; Free T4 was low at .47; Reverse T3 was low at 6.8 and TPO was off the charts at greater than 600. I don't have a General Practitioner. These results were from a blood test issued by my GYN and a blood test issued by a functional medicine doctor. My GYN put me on 100mg Levothyroxine. I have been on it for a week. My weight gain has been 45+ lbs over the past year.. and it is still climbing (even tho I exercise daily; eat whole unprocessed foods; have been dairy free; sugar free..). It is so frustrating. I am not sure low long it takes for Levothyroxine to start working.. and I know I won't immediately lose weight, but, I am wondering: Should I go see an endocrinologist? Should I be on other medication or homeopathic options (functional medicine doctor recommended several)? Is there something else I should do? I have gone through menopause.. never had hot flashes, sleep issues, etc. Getting frustrated with this continual weight gain.. Thanks for any feedback!\n",

I was recently (in Aug) diagnosed with Afib, and informed that my heart is beating a little to fast than it should be. I have been place on medication for both. My endocrinologist office told me to stop taking my Methimazole 10mgs at the end of Aug 2021. Next appt I could get with my endocrinologist was at the end of Sept 2021. I do email him/the office, through their portal. I have never been seen in person, due to COVID, so using the email has been a normal way to communicate with the office, and has worked, expect lately. Since I have gone off the thyroid medication I really haven't been able to get any help. His latest email just said \"you have Graves' hyperthyroidism, and have been taking methimazole.\" Well I know that because his office diagnosed me with that in March of 2021 and placed me on the methimazole then.

      "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism back in August 2020, and started with Synthroid (Levothyroxine) 25mg. Within 1 week I start having heart palpitation and the doctor said unless my heart rate is over 100, there's nothing to worry about, which according to my fitness tracker, it was not over 100. By November, I've had enough of the constant heart palpitation, especially at night, that I asked my doctor to reduce my dose to half (I cut the pill to half), and the palpitation seem to tone down a lot, though still happen sometimes. Here's the list of my lab result: TSH 3rd Generation (normal 0.45-5.33) 8/27/2020 10.08 (diagnosed with hypo, started with 25mg) 10/5/2020 2.55 11/30/2020 1.34 (complained about heart palpitation during visit, dr reduced to half dose, cutting 25mg in half, once a day) 12/31/2020 2.26 2/19/2021 7.27 (dr asked me to go back to full 25mg dose) 4/30/2021 3.85 so after I went back to full 25mg dose, the heart palpitation started again and getting worse, just this past week I kept waking up middle of night with pounding heart beat (rate around 80-90), and once I woke up I started sweating. during the day if I'm sitting still or not moving, I can count my heart beat without checking the pulse, worse during the night, after meal, and when I wake up. I'm having hard time falling asleep, and staying sleep, because I can feel the heart beat in my upper body. I'm scheduling a visit with my doctor again, but want to know if anyone has similar experience and what's your solution/remedy. What are other alternative? that I can bring to my doctor to discuss?

      "This year my thryroid ultrasound shows a \"partially calcified 6 x 6 x 5 mm very hypoechoic solid nodule with punctate internal echogenicities that were not evident previously\" (lab report wording). I have been getting thyroid ultrasounds every year since 2015 when the first nodules were found, but they have never gotten any larger & actually many were smaller. Labs done this year show TSH at 0.015 (range 0.465 - 4.680 uTU/mL) with Free T3 & T4 levels normal (above midrange). Last year my TSH was 1.15 & my T3 & T4 were a bit lower but still around midrange, so there is a significant difference this year. Yet my doctor doesn't seem concerned & just says to wait & do another ultrasound in a year.

      "Hello. I am a 47-year-old male, and I have autoimmune hypothyroidism. I recently heard that something called \"low-level laser therapy\" or \"cold-laser therapy\" can be used on a thyroid gland that has been damaged by Hashimoto's. Supposedly, the laser therapy will regenerate the thyroid gland, restore the ability of the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormone, and significantly reduce (or even eliminate entirely) a person's need for Synthroid. Has anyone on this forum received low-level laser therapy on the thyroid gland? Also, I have heard that some people buy these lasers online and proceed to apply this laser therapy onto their own thyroid glands (like a do-it-yourself project). Has anyone on this forum tried to use such a laser on his/her own thyroid? Any information would be appreciated. Thank you.\n",

I have an active 11 yr old 5ft 146lbs presenting with chest pain at random times not constant and not always during activity but happens multiple times a week, normal awake resting PR is on average 100bpm at its lowest and asleep PR average is high 80s to 90s. She is often super tired throughout the day but still makes her self stay active. She has been to a cardiologist that shows 12lead and all labs at the time appear to be within normal ranges. She has close family history of Hashimotos, maternal grandmother but she was only diagnosed a few yrs ago, and as a toddler had a low functioning thyroid that went into normal levels prior to needing medications. She started menstruation at 9, was also weighed 1 month prior and has gained 10lbs and in the last yr or so has gained around 60lb. Md wants to send her back to cardio even tho i never asked for cardio i asked for endo in the first place. But if i take her without referral i have to have a legitimate reason for insurance other then I'm an EMT and have a gut feeling. So should i go straight to endo to have them run the antibody test for Hashimotos or wait the 2 wks to get into cardio for them to say the same thing and then have to wait even longer to get her into endo.

Not sure if that matters or not. Should I get another test from somewhere else? I don't have insurance so it comes completely out of pocket and I am on a tight budget. Was hoping my doctor could give me more information when I went to her, but I don't feel like she took me seriously enough to run the complete panel. There has to be an explanation as to why I'm feeling the way I do. If it's not my thyroid, I have no idea what could be going on.\n",
      "Hello, Can anyone tell me what some safe and natural alternatives to Synthroid are?\n",
      "I feel like a sitting choking duck in a very rural area. 49 yr old female. This all started with pfhlem. I noticed alot of it and always having to hock it out. Then I started waking up at night choking on it. Within a couple of weeks, it progressed to actual shooting pain in the lower neck area, a swelled neck feeling, severe difficulty in swallowing (cant even swallow tiny pills) and the 'something stuck in my throat' feeling, headaches and lots of burping/gas.. I have had very little, broken sleep the past 7 weeks. Everything is even worse when I lay down. I call my doctor, have a video appt. Due to the pandemic. She said go to the ER. I travel the one hour to the ER at our small hospital (I live in a VERY rural area, health care is not all that great and very few specialists to speak of). With this pandemic going on, this is especially nerve racking and extremely scary. They did an iv and gave me anxiety med through it because I was hysterical. They did an MRI which showed nothing stuck in my throat, gave me some acid reflux meds, an anxiety med and referred me to a general surgeon for follow up. By the time I got into seeing the GS, my anxiety and panic attacks are full force. I literally felt on that day I was dying from being choked. He was annoyed with me. Did not really want to talk to me much and orders upper GI and throat scope and walks out of the room. Results are there is a small amount of acid reflux. There are also 3 stomach ulcers which may explain the need to burp all the time. He puts me on a PPI and sucralfate and not to take aspirin or any other Nsaids. Of course this does nothing for the choking feeling, and seems to help only mildly on the burping. He then ordered a chest xray (came back ok) and a thyroid ultrasound. The ultrasound showed no nodules but the results said inflamed. I then got bloodwork done. Those results came back as normal I just couldn't believe it. Here are the numbers: TSH 0.6630 uIU/mL (^^ this number was 1.6234 5 months ago) Free Thyroxine 1.08 ng/dL Thyroperoxidase Antibody 25 IU/mL Thyroglobulin Antibody < 20 IU/ml Reverse Triiodothyronine 14.2 ng/dl I was diagnosed three years ago with subclerical hyperthyroid. At the time, I didnt pay much attention to it. Nothing bothered me. This was diagnosed where I used to live, which is 3 hours away. I called them, they refused referral because they said the numbers where normal. I've been set up with an Endo via video in a few weeks, but not sure if I'll even make it that long without choking out and absolutely no specialist within 3 hours of me that seems to know anything about thyroid or what may be going on here. The Endo I have a video scheduled with isnt even in my state and I am having to wait 3 1/2 weeks and travel to the little hospital to even do a video call ! 😭 I got a two day break from this...praying it would not return...but now all of it is back, full force. I can't eat, can't sleep, can't concentrate. Noises irrite me. I get sore throats. My hands are shaky. The swelled choking and full of mucus in my throat is horrifically terryifying. I often have a headache. I have water next to the bed and sip it all night long. My anxiety is out of control. When the flare is real bad, I cradle myself and pull my hair and dont realize it until my husband stops me, this is how ridiculous this is. Just my husband walking past the couch sends me through the roof.This feels like an imminent threat to my 'being' and is destroying my life and nobody seems to think any of it is a big deal while I feel like I am choking and going A wall. I am going back, again, to my regular doctor today. I dont know what to say other than everything I've already told them. Does anybody, anywhere have any suggestions or insight about this at all 😭😭. Thank you so very much for any advice at all\n",
      "Hi, I did one of those mail in tests after experiencing some symptoms (unexplained weight gain etc) and these were the results - T4 - 87 nmol/L (normal) TSH - 2.87 mlU/L (normal) FT4 - 14.6 pmol/l (normal) T3 - 4.6 pmol/L (normal) TPO - < 9.0 IU/ml (normal) TGAB - 298 IU/mL (high - range should be between 0 and 115) Cortisol - 19.8 ug/dL (high - range should be between 6 and 8.4) Any insight on this? I am seeing a doctor tomorrow and want to know what type of questions to ask, what tests to push for. Any idea of what those levels might indicate?\n",
      "Hello! Without boring you guys to tears, I'm dealing with some symptoms(random leg hair loss, sudden weight gain, brain fog, constipation, dry skin, vision changes, fatigue, etc) and I recently had blood work done. Some results I took note of: Ldl chol calc: 117 (high) Free Thyroxine Index 1.4 T3 uptake: 26 Thyroxine T4: 5.5 TSH: 2.65 After doing much research, it lines up with a lot of the hypothyroidism symptoms I read about.

      "—For 9 years, I took 1 grain/65 mg Naturthroid and felt good —Went through menopause a couple years ago —Suddenly in Dec 2019, I went hyper (main symptoms were mini anxiety surges and heart skipping beats; confirmed by blood test) —Dumped my old GP (who was pretty new to me) who didn't know what to do or how to listen —Found naturopath who tested several different thyroid meds (including synthetic)...all made me hyper —Stopped taking thyroid and 6 weeks later was most hypo I'd ever been (TSH was 17 and felt crappy) —Started taking Naturthroid 1/4 gr/15 mg and 6 weeks later had TSH of 8 and felt a lot better, but could be better —Naturthroid recalled for having decreased efficacy —Started alternating remaining 1/4 gr/15 mg Naturthroid and 1/4 gr/15 mg Armour with intent to fully transition to Armour —Within 3 days was having same hyper symptoms that I had back in December Both my dr and I are totally stumped. 1/4 gr/15 mg Naturthroid almost gets me where I need to be, but I still needed more. 1/4 gr/15 mg Armour makes me hyper. Now Naturthroid isn't available. The only thing we can come up with is that I had been pretty sick with a virus (early Covid???) in Nov...it was a couple weeks later that my thyroid wacked out. At this point, I'm thinking of taking 1/4 gr/15 mg Armour every other day and see where that gets me. Anyone have any info I can give my doctor to help us figure this out?\n",
      "I was diagnosed 6 days ago and put on Levo 25 mcg/day. Any suggestions on how to cope with fatigue and weight gain. I walk daily at least 2 miles even before diagnosis. Should I add any supplements?\n",
      "I desperately looking for answers of why I feel so horrible. Short back story... I was diagnosed borderline hoshimoto' s disease when I was 10 and was put on synthroid when I was 21. I have had 3 successful pregnancies with this disease and consider myself lucky. Since my last pregnancy 3 years ago my thyroid keeps bouncing from over medicated to undereducated. Recently I was at my endocrinologist complaining of hyper symptoms but my THE showed 1.92. So she told.me I was normal and sent me on my way. I last 7 days until I couldn't take the racing heart, shortness of breath and basically wanting to jump out of my skin and I went to the emergency room. They did a thyroid panel and it showed my TSH .243 and my t4 and free t4 were out of range. My doctor did a slight med change that did not give me any relief. I kept calling and begging for her to lower my synthroid dose that was 200mcg every day but Sunday I would take 100 mcg. She would have her nurse call me that couldn't answer my questions and told me to just not take a pill Sunday. I couldn't function taking care of my kids with the severe anxiety and panic attacks. Unfortunately, I was desperate and lowered my dose to 150mcg on my own telling myself I would rather have hypo symptoms than hyper. I found a new doctor who I don't love but I'm stuck with now. He kept me at 150mcg telling me I made a significant decrease but if I felt better than it was ok. Low and behold 3 weeks later on the new dose I am having extreme fatigue, muscle weakness and tingling in my hands. My most annoying symptom right now is that certain spots of my face feel numb and tingly. It comes and goes and is always on different sides. After this long tale.of woe, I am wondering if I should call my new doctor tomorrow and ask for a med change or hang on till my appt in 3 weeks to get a good reading on my levels. It's the facial tingling that's flipping me out. It started last week. If anyone has a similar situation it would help put my mind at ease. It's difficult with the 3 kids to feel like this.\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "I was originally diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism about 4-5 years ago, and have for the most part been stable with a tsh between 1.5 and 2 (It spiked a bit last year nearing 4.2, but it was also not long after moving and being super stressed out, which probably didn't help). I've stayed on the starting dose of 25 mcg, with the exception of a couple months that I tried armour thyroid before switching back due to insurance issues. I've been thinking about trying CBD oil for my Panic Disorder (I'm less worried now that recreational marijuana is now legal in IL; I know the two aren't connected per say, but I'm a worry wart), but I don't want it to negatively affect my thyroid. Do any of y'all have experience in using CBD while being hypothyroid?\n",

      "Hey there, I’m hoping to get some guidance and advice because I’ve been frustrated with my Levothyroxine dose for a few years now. Some background: i’m a 37 y/o female and was diagnosed with papillary/follicular variant thyroid cancer at 25. I had a total thyroidectomy and a few rounds of iodine treatments. Since then, I’ve been cancer free. I started on Levo and was at 175mcg at the beginning, and I’ve slowly gone down to 137mcg. My doctor had me switch to 137 because he said my bloodwork warranted the results, but I told him that about 6-8 weeks after the switch, I started to gain weight a lot easier, needed 9-10 hours of sleep a night, and my hair started to thin out. I also got cold a lot easier and my fingers and toes were always freezing in the winter, and I just felt off. He tested me again to make sure and said my bloodwork still warranted the 137 dosage. So for the last two years or so, I’ve just lived with it. I started to get really serious about my weight (I was probably 20lbs overweight before my dose was switched to 137) and since my last appt a year ago, I lost 12 lbs. I know it’s not a lot, but I really watch what I eat and workout like crazy, and it’s still so hard to lose weight. Just the other day at my yearly Endo appt, he said my labs indicated a lower dose to 128mcg (not exactly sure, but it was 120-something). I asked why and he said I was overstimulated more than needed, even for a cancer patient, and since I had lost weight, that probably prompted the change in my labs. I took a look at my labs (honestly, for the first time in years) and he only tested me for Thyroglobulin and Thyroglobulin antibodies. No TSH or anything else. I’m the kind of person who usually just does whatever the doctor says because I’m sure it’s hard for them for everyone to come in and say “well, I read this online ...” after they went through years of medical school. But I’m actually terrified to go on this lower dose when I feel like i’m already struggling with my current one. And I reiterated my symptoms to him at my most recent visit. I was more or less told that labs don’t lie and if I continue to lose weight, I should feel better. Should I ask to be tested for the standard thyroid panels? Even if I’m a cancer thyroid patient, is it standard to only test for Thyroglobulin? Is questioning him warranted? I would just love any advice from those more experienced than myself. Thank you so much.\n",
      "I am extremely sensitive to changes in my TSH. When I go hypo I become severely depressed and anxious. Right now I am over-medicated. My TSH is .071 and I have felt irritable and anxious all week and it scares me that my depression is coming back. We are decreasing my Synthroid and recheck in 6 weeks. My questions are: do other thyroid sufferers deal with mood disorders AND do you consider my TSH to be hyper? My free T4 was normal. Please let me hear from my fellow mood disorder sufferers😄!!!\n",
      "Hello, I had my thyroid ablated and then placed on synthroid. I was placed on it fairly quickly post ablation, they waited till my TSH showed I was hypothyroid. I only gained 4 lbs so basically not much weight gain post ablation. I've always been very active and normal BMI. I continue to walk, play tennis and do light weight lifting throughout the week. I am irritated because, as soon as I started taking synthroid, I developed a lot of cellulite on the front of my thighs and arms. The doctors say it's because of hypothyroidism but my TSH is normal and I am a fit person. Why is no one acknowledging that synthroid causes this??? I read several bloggers on this matter, on this site c/o the same thing so I know I am not out of my mind on this matter. I am hoping to get some comments from others with this issue too.

      "Hello, My son (13) has had pretty much all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism for the past few years. His quality of life stinks. Doctors have even tried psychotropic medications for his depression and fatigue symptoms a few years ago, but they did not help. His last year of blood tests, his TSH levels were as follows: 3.3, 5.8, 8.5, and 4.2. Doctor said he would think about treating when he saw 8.5 and had us make an appointment. But then he ordered more tests at appointment and now numbers look low again at 4.2. Is it normal for TSH to fluctuate like this? We have tried various things to figure out what is going on, but all of his symptoms always lead my search back to hypothyroidism. Does anyone think this is possible with these blood results that he could in fact have hypothyroidism? Thank you.\n",
      "I really hope some one can shed some light on to my inquiry. I will try to be brief. For the most part for as long as I have known my wife (8 years) she has had these characteristics (I will elaborate below) and its been off and on how much these things bother me. Well its gotten to a point were I cant wait anymore and I am beginning to think there is a medical origin to most if not all what I am about to say. Here are some \"symptoms\" I think she has that I have cross referenced online with a possible thyroid condition. - She generally lacks energy and stamina. (Our running joke is that I have 6 batteries while she has two.) She NEEDS a nap during the day even on a good nights rest. She has always been this way. In grade school her mother would warn teachers that she will probably fall asleep during class. The duration of her sleep has always been fairly short compared to me 6-7 hours maybe. - She almost has no sex drive. (might have to do with the energy thing but possibly hormonal). - She is quick to anger and slow to calm down. One moment we can be reminiscing of a romantic memory (and all is well in the world) then I do \"something\" to anger the beast and suddenly I am enemy number one, and there is no talking her down or reasoning with her. She is just ANGRY. She has even admitted she has issues with anger. - She gets these muscle cramps in both her calf muscles. She has described it like restless leg syndrome. She gets these regardless of physical activity pretty much daily. - She has dealt with bad depression in the past but even today dealing with family issues can put her in a slump for days on end. - Her hair has been on the course and thin side (notably more so than the average women) - Lets even through in intolerance to cold (however she is Chinese and they hate the cold, but worth mentioning). One more caveat: We had a baby a year ago (she was like this before the baby) and doctors did checks on her blood/hormone levels while she was pregnant. Everything checked out then. Would pregnancy throw thyroid hormones out of wack or do they not even check that on pregnant women. Or is this low testosterone .... uhhh I don't know, very frustrating. I know no one can say for sure without blood work but can someone give me their opinion on this. Give us a reason to get blood work done. Thanks! (BTW we live and work in China so bear that in mind when giving advice of medical treatment).\n",

While googling all the scary terms on the report, I googled this one too, and it sounds scarier than all the neck stuff that's listed, especially when I saw 5% are cancerous and that means 1 in 20, and half an inch is pretty big for something as small as a thyroid. I have an appointment in two weeks with my PCP. Should I call every day for an opening earlier? Should I be comforted that I have no signs of hyperthyroidism?

      "Hi everyone. I had a thyroid ablation in 2011 and have been teeter tottering with my tsh ever since. The highest dose of synthroid that I have been on is 94mcg a day. My tsh was 5.60 back in December of 2018 when I was on a dosage of 100/75 alternating daily. Then I increased the dosage to 100/100/75 and my tsh went to 3.41 so i continued to increase to 100/100/100/75 then starting over on that routine hoping to keep lowering my tsh. It finally went down to 2.41(.30-4.20) normal range. At that point I started getting diarreah about 7 times a day running low grade fevers got tremors and extreme muscle weakness and shooting pains. Felt like I have had the flu for the past 9 months. I then backed off of my synthroid to 87 mcg a day and the tremors went fevers stopped and diarreah stopped. But I’m so exhausted and my muscles ache and my joints hurt to even move them. I got my thyroid checked a weak ago and the tsh is 6.70(.30-4.20) free t4 .90. (.70-1.90) total t4 8.7 free t3 2.6.

      "Hello! I'm new to this and need some advice/help/guidance. I'm 25 female. My sister and my mom both have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism so my doctor has been watching my thyroid to see if I end up having the same. Well three weeks ago my blood work for TSH was 0.04. Which is not what I was expecting. My endocrinologist appointment isn't until the end of November. It's a bit shocking that I could have hyperthyroidism. I'm easily fatigued, mood swings, heat intolerance, stomach issues, and big-time weight problems. Here's the thing since I've been easily tired I thought it was just stressed from work and other symptoms started I just thought it was caused by my weight. I'm struggling big time with my weight, unlike the common symptom of weight loss, it's really easy for me to gain weight. My activity levels and eating habits since (I would say symptoms started in February) haven't really changed that drastically. I also have the strangest dreams and suffered from night terrors. I'm a little worried that because I'm having these problems something is seriously wrong. Anyone else have these problems with hyperthyroidism? Keep in mind I haven't seen a specialist yet.\n",

      "Hi Everyone, I joined these message boards because I am seeking advice and guidance about what I think is a hypothyroidism issue. I have *ridiculous* symptoms. As in: I'm always cold, I gained ~60 pounds over the course of a year without changing anything. Dieted/fasted and nada. nothing. zip. I lose a pound, I gain a pound. My skin bruises easily, my nails are so brittle they snap off and flake, with ridges, my hair is thinning so much you can see my scalp I have ligament laxity and have injured myself to the point of needing 3 ligament repairs I have deQuervain's tenosynovitis, plantar fasciitis, a torn hip flexor... Vertigo, tinnitus, extreme fatigue, insomnia Family history of thyroid disease. I've cut out gluten, raw goitrogens, all soy, dairy, nightshades. So the \"doctors\" test me for hypothyroidism and every time they say it's normal and they tell me to \"eat less move more\" (until my last ligament surgery, I was exercising 8 hours a week min). Here are my numbers for the only 2 tests the stingy health\"care\" provider have been willing to get me: TSH - 3.43 uIU/ml, free T4 - 0.94 ng/dL. And they are within the range provided so he does nothing, other than to tell me again to eat less and move more. So I did some research about acceptable ranges, and possibly the TSH is not normal? I sent the \"doctor\" with my research, my pitch for a full thyroid panel (TSH, T4, free T4, T3, free T3, T3 uptake, reverse T3, TPO Ab, Tg Ab) and all he is willing to do is TPO Ab (I have a fairly recent TSH and free T4 so that's all good, but none of the others), which I guess is a minor win. Do you guys think I should push back and try to get the additional tests? What could fall through the cracks if I don't get the other tests done? What are you guys' thoughts on the existing test #s, specifically the TSH? Thanks in advance\n",
      "Hi everyone I have zero idea what I’m dealing with here. Neither does my doc. Was dc with Hashimotos 3 years ago - have always had high antibodies. My Thyroglobulin was just tested and was very high, (NOT the antibodies - those were also high but I’m talking about just the Thyroglobulin). Doc doesn’t know what this means. Endo basically doesn’t care. I had an ultrasound two years ago and it showed a small thyroid with heterogeneous features and no nodules. Does this Thyroglobulin mean anything? Could it signify cancer given normal-ish ultrasound? Please help?\n",
      "My Granddaughter is 22 and just had blood work done for her thyroid. Her symptoms are, cannot lose weight, extreme fatigue, depression very dry skin. Her results came back and she's with in normal ranges. I know you can be within normal ranges, but be close to being outside the normal ranges, whether high or low thyroid levels. The range on her test is as follows: .4 to 4.5 Her result was .96 does someone know how to interpret this as to whether she could be close to being out of range as too hyper or hypo? Thank you so much.\n",
      "Hi, I don't know if anyone can help me? I was told I have a thyroid nodule and it is now 10mm. I am supposed to go back in 6 months times as the doctor said they need to monitor the nodule, but I was surprised at the lack of information or urgency. I am left feeling worried as they didn't offer to take a biopsy. Would they know if it was cancerous from the ultra sound? The next time I go back should I insist on a biopsy? I was also reading about radiotherapy to decrease the size of the nodule, does anyone know what is the best treatment for nodules. Thank you! 🙂\n",
      "Hey guys. Sorry, not sure if this is the best group. Wanted to ask the group about some weirdness my body has been through. I am including a bit of other info in case could be relevant. Sorry if post is a bit long. End of May 2019 I got hit with gastritis, duodenditis, and other GI inflammation suspected to be from nsaids, alcohol and major stress a had been enduring. Prior to this point, i felt completely normal, healthy, etc Confirmed gastritis with colonoscopy/endoscopy on June 24, 2019. Gi doc gave medications to help heal (carafate and took pepcid). All biopsies were negative for anything sinister or could be a cause. Nsaids suspected to be related to cause. Throughout the month of June, while trying to manage gastritis and pain, diet, etc, i had lost 27lbs from eating so little and no appetite from the GI pain. Today i feel much better (mostly) and i'm eating a whole lot better now. Taking a step back, about last week of June, i had visited doc about some concerns (had some anxiety), he took a blood test and the only thing out of range was my vitamin D (at 19 ng/mL). Doc said this wasnt terribly low and said it should be quick to get back into range. Their lab testing ranges for Vitamin D are as follows: Deficiency : <20 ng/mL Insufficiency : 20-29 ng/mL Optimum Level : 30-80 ng/mL Possible Toxicity : >80 ng/mL Doctor prescribed Vit D2 (Ergocalciferol) 50000 iu weekly for 12 weeks. I've taken my 4th week dose this last Monday. I feel like I have been soooo dehydrated, dry mouth, tingles, and urinating a lot. I've been drinking so much water, but feels like goes right through me. I've also had decreased sweating, even outside in 90 degree heat. Been tired, cold, chills, etc I'm a bigger guy, and i normally sweat a lot. So this is completely unusual for me, even though i did end up losing just a bit over 30lbs altogether. I've recently found if i eat something really salty (ramen, etc) then drink more water, i feel like i retain fluids a bit normal, i can sweat again! Did some research and found that Ergocalciferol can contribute to increased urination, dehydration symptoms. Also in my searches, found there was some correlation between Vitamin D and Calcium levels. I looked at my past calcium blood labs. All previous labs had my calcium in the 9ish range, including early in June 2019 when i was first getting workup for what was determined to be my gastritis. My most recent calcium blood range from last week was 10.2, which is after i had been taking the Vitamin D2 supplement for 2-3 weeks or so. Questions: 1. Can Vitamin D supplements increase calcium levels? 1b. is blood calcium level of 10.2 considered high? (since ive taken another 50000iu dose since blood test, i wonder if could be higher now.) 2. Anyone experience dehydration/increased urination from ergocalciferol? 2b. Could the dehydration be from the Vit d supplement itself? Or could it possibly be from higher calcium levels? 3. I've read that high-dose vitamin d supplementation might not be the best, and to look at taking D3 instead. What is the general thought on this? 4. Could part of the vit D deficiency be from the rapid weight loss i sustained while i had gastritis and was afraid to eat anything? 5. What can i do to lower calcium levels? Stopping D2 supplement? take Magnesium? 6. Can just simply being dehydrated increase blood calcium levels? I'm feeling much better after getting over those GI issues, i'm just trying to figure out why i feel so dehydrated all the time, urinating so much, dry mouth, etc. I had A1C and blood glucose checked and all are completely normal. I was starting to consider a thing called Diabetes Insipidus, but i am not thirsty all the time and i found vitamin D supplementation could have similar side effects of dehydration. Thinking i might stop the ergocalciferol and see if dehydration symptoms subside. Then try daily D3 supplement after some time... Any thoughts on this? How long could this take to correct? Thanks for reading!\n",

      "Hi, I'm looking for some advice. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in April 2018 but I'm not sure if it was because I asked to see a specialized that they offered to treat me. Initial blood labs were done by general doctor. Endocrinologist said it was hypothyroidism and mentioned possibly Hashimoto’s. My main complaint was being cold and brain fog. I was started on Levoxyl 25 mcg at this visit under the endocrinologist direction. At this point in January 2019 I've never seen much different in body heat and brain fog seems a wee bit better but not much. Anxiety has gone up a lot!

      "Hello everyone, My name is Nat. I have recently been going through a worsening of my anxiety, depression and OCD Symptoms, and after dealing with this for about three weeks, i have begun to wonder if it's possible that it could be related to my thyroid. About a year ago, I gotten testing done my my results for my TSH was 4.97. I know this is the normal range 0.450-4.500 (uIU/mL). T4 - 1.37. But didn't receive medication or anything. I don't know much about the thyroid and it's conditions, so I am not sure if it could be related. Though I have been experiencing the physical symptoms of Hypo. Such as, Hair loss Dry skin Constipation Weight Issues etc. Mentally, I can't concentrate on much. Have Obsessive thinking that has seem to have gotten worse. Weird Intrusive thoughts and just feeling overall anxious, and getting depressed. I see a Psych and Therapist, am prescribed medication for over 5 years now. And I believe I was doing okay for a time. Until I stopped the antidepressant, but started it up again. But since I never really thought about the thyroid I wanted to know if it can be an issue? I am getting blood work done again tomorrow. Thanks for reading!\n",
      "UPDATE: Thyroid removed 3-13-18 and put on 112 synthroid(name brand) 6 day after surgery Recently T4 went up higher and I began having the stomach issues once again and diarrhea. I also have had some rapid heartbeat, up to 120 on occasion so am unable to stop the Propranolol entirely which I would like to do, so I can also stop the Eliquis. But until they are sure I am stable on synthroid and no risk of A-fib my cardiologists want me to take the Propanolol or wean off, but take it heart rate goes up. As long it still goes up they fear A-Fib and risk of stroke so are insistent I stay on it for now. Thursday 4/25, night I woke up at 4 AM with extremely bad stomach pains, drenched in sweat and had diarrhea. I took immodium and went back to sleep. Woke up around 7 AM with it again, took my Synthroid and went back to sleep. Around 11 AM it began again and this time it was just bright red blood with clear mucous so I called my gastro and then called my cardiologists because they have me on Eliquis. They said go to ER to rule out a bleed from the Eliquis. ER did cat scan, labs, stool samples etc. but insisted I stay overnight to monitor. I saw the gastro the next day( 8 days ago), no more blood and he cleared me to go home and said it was colitis and IB most likely. I was on a heart monitor the entire time and they saw no more A-Fib but did catch a couple periods of tachycardia. Not bad but once up to 128 just from walking a few feet to the bathroom. They gave me the propranolol and it went down. They did run labs on Free T4 and TSH but not T3. Anyway…. the T4 is up since my labs and the TSH is down. T4 is now higher than it has ever been. They said to call my endocrinologist and let him know T4 was now 1.77 (0.76-1.46) HIGH. I was released the next day and called the office and spoke with my endo on call Saturday and endo on call said skip Synthroid Sunday and then take 1/2 of 112 Synthroid on Monday and call my regular endo on Monday, which I did. He changed me from 112 to 100 Synthroid based on T4 up and TSH heading downward.. I am due for labs on May 6, tomorrow. Yesterday and today I am feeling worse…. that cold feeling I had before the Synthroid kicked in is returning, so is the tired, achy feeling, I am tempted to just start back on the 112 before he gets the new labs.

      "Good afternoon, My daughter has seen an endocrinologist for the past 7 years. They have always taken a wait and see approach. This year she is 14 and has had frequent headaches along with tiredness, more so than normal. The PCM ordered initial labs that came back negative for Mono/EBV. However, it showed a significant Vitamin D deficiency (18 IU) and elevated TSH at 6.9. The PCM immediately ordered repeat labs to include antibody tests. The TSH came back down but it was positive for TPO antibodies at 108 IU> The PCM then put in a referral to the Endo (we have seen for years) and ordered an US prior to the apportionment. The US came back with bilateral multinodular thyroid with the largest 2 measuring at 5MM each tin the lower pole of the left thyroid. I want to be sure we advocate for her at this point, She is clearly symptomatic with several factors reflecting thyroiditis and what I think is probably Hashimoto;s disease. Any suggestions? Should we ask for biopsies? Should we advocate for treatment? Thank You Jennifer\n",

I understand the possibility of missing the cancer cells by the biopsy. My doctor wants to remove my thyroid due to the size of the nodules. i'm not experiencing any symptoms other than fullness in my neck and sometimes food gets stuck while eating.

      "I had hyperactive parathyroid levels of 128 in June of 2017, it was tagged as high, but dr never mentioned it to me. Then in June of 2018 again the parathyroid level was even higher at 192. The dr wanted to rule out that it was a secondary hyperactive parathyroid and put me on vitamin D, which took it down to normal level of 67 in Oct 2018. Now my vitamin D has significantly increased from 15 to 30, but the parathyroid hormone has risen again to 87, which is only slightly high. Had an ultrasound yesterday morning and called saying I have a 1.8 cm nodule on my thyroid and they were making me an urgent appointment with an endocronologist. I'm afraid things have been ignored or not taken seriously until now and wonder how long I've had this nodule and where has it spread? Any words of encouragement or information would be helpful.

      "Hi all- My husband and daughter have had thyroid nodules for years so I wasn't too excited when I reviewed my records and saw this on multiple MRI/CTs: \"T2 hyperintense nodule within the right thyroid lobe\". It has been there since at least 2017 and nobody at Kaiser ever mentioned it to me. I requested an ultrasound in Feb-2019 which showed: Right Lobe: Homogeneous echogenicity. It measures 1.7 x 1.3 x 4.3 cm. 8 x 8 x 10 mm partially cystic nodule with microcalcifications Left Lobe: Homogeneous echogenicity. It measures 1.6 x 1.1 x 4.5 cm. 9 x 5 x 10 mm partially cystic nodule with microcalcifications Isthmus: It measures 0.2 cm in thickness. 7 x 3 x 8 mm ovoid hypoechoic nodule. No mention of lymph nodes, vascularity, location on the report. My PCP referred me to endocrinology, and they responded to her saying: \"They [endos] did not think that the cysts appeared worrisome and felt that monitoring them with another ultrasound in 1 year\". I'm under the impression that basing risk only on size is \"out\" and that microcalcifications and hypoechogenicity are cause for concern, particularly with nodules located in the isthmus. I do get that most of these are benign, but does \"go away and come back in year\" (when it will have been 3 years) sound like an appropriate response to you folks? Thanks\n",
      "I'm scheduled for a biopsy for a nodule on my left thyroid that was found around 8 years ago, under 1cm, that has decided to make a definite growth spurt over the past 2 years. I believe my nodule growth spurt began in the fall of 2017 when I experienced a very sore throat and extreme hoarseness over a 4 month period that my doctor could find no cause. Within the next 6 months I started having trouble swallowing and labored breathing when exerting myself, and was sent to a speech therapist who scheduled a barium swallow which I cancelled and stopped seeing her because I felt I wasn't seeing the right type of doctor for my problems. In hindsight I probably should have had the barium swallow, it might have picked up this nodule pushing against my throat as I believe it is. I'm hopeful that maybe some of my discomfort can be relieved during the biopsy if some of the fluid can be drained out of the nodule if it is fluidy.\n",
      "So a little back story. I've had a sore throat for a good 5 months. Off and on feeling of something in my throat for at least a year. Had an endoscopy and saw 2 ENT's, the most recent ENT visit this past January, everything was good. Did have my esophagus dilated but nothing found. Fast forward to last week, I just kept getting a nagging feeling that my sore throat wasn't normal. Dr felt my thyroid/throat and only ordered an ultrasound because I asked and he felt my thyroid was slightly enlarged. I have gotten my results back from the ultrasound and I think I understand them but maybe someone can read this and clarify it more: Findings: gland is mildly enlarged and demonstrates a heterogeneous echotexture. The right lobe measures 5.0X1.4X1.5cm. The left lobe measures 4.9X1.6X1.4cm. There are multiple small solids nodules in either lobe. On the right side, 4 solid well-circumscribed nodules are noted all appearing hypoechoic. The largest of these is noted in the midportion of the right lobe, measuring 9X7X7 mm. The other well-circumscribed solid nodules have a similar appearance and all measure 7 mm in diameter or less. In the left lobe, 3 small well-circumscribed hypoechoic solid nodules are noted. The largest of these is noted in the midportion of the lobe measuring 8X6X3 mm. The other nodules measure 6mm in diameter or less. Impression: Multiple small well-circumscribed solid nodules in either lobe as detailed above. Suggest follow-up thyroid sonogram in 9-12 months time. So with all that being said, I immediately started googling and found thyroid cancer is pretty rare however, I came across anaplastic cancer and scared the crap out of myself. My dr is having me go to yet a different ENT in 2 weeks and see what they say. I'm very scared. Especially if it turns out to be the anaplastic kind. Of course my mind goes to worst case. Any insight would be awesome. Thank you so much Tonya\n",
      "Good evening I am 36 years old and I have recently been dealing with thyroid issues. I went to my doctor and all he tested was my TSH,so I found a naturopath who listened and understood my symptoms. I had a full thyroid panel done. My TSH was normal 1.65,free t3 was very low ,free t4 was very low and my thyroid antibodies were at 16. My naturopath put me on 60mg desicated thyroid in the AM and mid afternoon 5mcg cytomel I felt great for about two weeks but then I felt the exact same again. Still bloated,tired and sluggish. 3 months on my meds and we checked my blood my t4 DROPPED from 11.1 to 9.1 which is below the reference range. My t3 went up from 3.32 to 3.86 My doctor then upped my desicated thyroid to 90 mg and t3 15mg Today I did blood work for something separate and my TSH is 0.02!!!!!! *** why is my thyroid getting weaker ? I’m so confused. I don’t know if I should stop going to her and go see an actual endocrinologist?? PLEASE help if you can. Any advice would be greatly appreciated\n",

      "Hello all, I am looking for any experiences/advice as how to move forward. I have a family history of thyroid issues going back four generations. I just hit my 30s and have been feeling like I am showing signs of hypothyroid: fatigue, cold, depression, difficulty losing weight, dry brittle hair, dry rashy skin, cracking nails, muscle aches, low libido, weirdly elevated LDL etc. My tests results came back incredibly normal (TSH 1.5, T4 8.2, Free T3 3.1, Ferritin 48) except for T3 Uptake: 22% (range 24%-39%) Free T4: .98 (range .82-1.77 but seems a bit low) My understanding from attempting to read science articles is that this could be a number of things not delivering enough accessible hormones and giving me symptoms of hypo even if my thyroid functioning correctly... an estrogen or testosterone issue to a nutritional deficiency to a pituitary issue to stress to some other systemic disorder. Ack! Could this still be early subclinical hypothyroid? Would it be worth getting an antibodies test for Hashimotos? Any other ideas of other lab tests that might be helpful? Anybody have similar results? I have awful, high deductible health insurance so am wary of going to an endocrinologist until I feel more convinced they are not going to just say everything is perfectly normal.

      "I could use some guidance. I have multiple nodules on my thyroid. One shrunk from last year, one stayed the same, and one grew. I've had them biopsied the past 2 years and they are not cancer.

My Dr did blood work and my tsh is 1.58 and my free t4 is 2.38 (normal range .58-1.64) so he said it looks like hyperthyroidsm. I felt relieved that my symptoms finally had a cause but my Dr then did a free t4 by dialysis and that came back at 1.8 (normal 1.1-2.4) so I'm in the normal range. He said everything looks good so he'll see me in a year. Has anyone ever had results like this and had symptoms of hyper but are told you're normal? I don't know where to do go from here or what I should do. I've felt so bad for so long. Every year I tell my Dr all my symptoms and I have labs done and I'm told they're normal.

The doctor tried to add a T3 supplement. I didn't tolerate it well. My TSH numbers have not been below 40 and it's been as high as 70. I have always been hypothyroid never hyperthyroid. I am unsure what to try next. One strange thing is I suffered 2nd & 3rd degree burns over 10% of my body. I was in the burn unit for a few days. During that time I didn't take my thyroid medication. I feel better without the Synthroid. I had acid reflux that was causing me to take the maximum dose of every antacid there is.. I am eating the same if not more.. you need more calories when you have been burnt. But have not had reflux since not taking the Synthroid. I take in under 1500 calories a day and under 25 grams of carbs and I am still 25-35 pounds overweight. Has anyone else had the problem with Synthroid causing reflux and anxiety ? Has anyone else had there TSH over 40 for years ? Thanks for any advice anyone may have about this.\n",
      "I have hypothyroidism and I have had a couple instances in which my adam's apple aches. I have also experienced shooting pain up the side of my neck in my throat. My Dr. just shrugs and says it is probably a nerve thing. The pain in my adam's apple was a deep gripping ache that lasted for about five seconds at a time. The pain in the side of my neck is sharper and lasts a fraction of a second. I also feel like the left side of my neck is heavy when I bend over. Almost like there is a cable running through it with invisible strings pulling the cable down. Again when I spoke to my physician about the sensation he just shrugs.\n",
      "I'm new here. I'd really appreciate some help with my results. My doc is encouraging me to do radioactive iodine treatment. I'm hesitant. These were my test results in July: TSH 0.06 FT4 0.78 FT3 4.4 I'm finding no resources for low tsh and ft4 with high ft3. Doc adjusted my methimazol dose, I gained 10lbs and my results two weeks ago are: TSH 0.23 FT4 0.9 FT3 3.0 I'm having trouble sleeping and concentrating, have a high heart rate, but also can't lose any weight. Doc says it can't be a pituitary issue since the FT3 is elevated. I'm don't know what to think.\n",

      "I’m new to this board. Diagnosed with hypothyroid 6 months ago. My first TSH was 259 which was off the charts and FT4 0.4. I tested negative for Hashimoto and endo believes my thyroid shut down due to taking overdose of iodine supplements. I’ve been taking synthroid at various levels and my thyroid started to improve and went off of it in October. My numbers have since gone back up/down. My TSH is 11.45 and my FT4 is 0.89. They have me back on 25mcg of synthroid. Last month they also found out my ferritin was 20 so I’ve been on iron supplements. My question is related to symptoms. I’ve read about all the hypo symptoms on sites and I don’t see much about numbness and tingling I feel in my arms and sometimes legs. I do also have cold hands and feet but this is like pins and needles and my muscle feel like they are burning. Has anyone else experienced this? I know some say neuropathy results from weight gain but I’m the opposite. I’m thin and underweight!\n",
      "Hi Everyone. I was just recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I was diagnosed with a goiter about 5 years ago. Ever since I’ve had my thyroid levels checked once a year to make sure everything is ok. Earlier this month I went for a routine physical and I asked the doctor to re-check all of my lab work including my thyroid. I was concerned about fatigue, hand tremors and muscle weakness. The thyroid level TSH is normal, but the T4 level is elevated. Now that I’ve been researching thyroid problems I’m realizing that I have more than a few of the symptoms. Never tied it all together before now. Symptoms include the goiter, fatigue, hand tremors, muscle weakness, hot flashes, increased appetite, trouble losing weight, hairs on neck and double vision. I have an appointment with an endocrinologist on 1/28/19. Just looking for advice and support regarding this new diagnosis. Thanks. JJ\n",

      "About 9 months ago I began to experience double-vision --vertical with the second image (under the real image) displayed at an angle. Vision is clear if I close one eye at a time. If I raise my head a few inches I can see more clearly. Current diagnosis is 4th nerve palsy of unknown cause. After several eye doctor visits and a clear MRI, no cause has been discovered. Has anyone experienced this problem? It may be thyroid related. I have had no trauma to my head. I do take 75 mg of Armour thyroid daily. All blood tests came back normal, including for Myasthenia Gravis. Has anyone experienced this problem? Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!\n",
      "Hi all, After going gluten free some months ago (yes I was off the charts gluten sensitive) and developing hyper symptoms due to better absorption (rapid pulse, high pulse pressure, loose bowels, etc) I've \"stepped down\" from 120 mcg Levothyroxine to 50 mcg Levothyroxine. Oct 15 I dropped from 75 mcg to 50 mcg. Four weeks later on Nov 15 my TSH was 6.4 (as expected, a bit high as my body was adjusting to less meds). However, staying on 50 mcg my next blood test 2 weeks later showed TSH at 3.2 and then again two weeks later TSH is down to 2.1. Doc thinks I am absorbing Levothyroxine much better and I am going to step down again to 25 mcg. I continue to have the hyper symptoms (loose bowels, high pulse pressure, racing heart, sweating at night, weakness) on and off but mostly on. Also my antibodies prior to gluten free was 140 but since gluten free have been in normal range with quarterly checks. Also my only nodule has disappeared. Vitamins/nutrients all good and excellent health other than my thyroid.\n",
      "My labs are: TSH 2.52 Free T4 0.67 I take 120 mg of Armour daily, which was increased from 90, only because I requested it a few months ago. I continue to gain weight and struggle with most of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, although i have seen some improvement. Recommendations? Could my low T4 indicate a pituitary problem, and if so is there a natural way to supplement? TIA! Debbi\n",
      "I was previously on 125mcg Levothyroxine & 25mcg Liothyronine daily. My doc left the area & the new one insisted on trying Nature-throid instead. Seemed cool because it's all natural. Thing is, he put me on 97.5mg of Nature-throid & I feel AWFUL...as bad as I did before I was first diagnosed. I have another 3 wks before the next lab & office visit & I honestly don't know if I can make it that long! Isn't he severely UNDER-dosing me compared to what I was on before?\n",
      "Since the change in Naturethroid formulation, I have gone hypo with a bunch of symptoms. To name a few; fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, brain fog, depression and dry skin. My labs are a mess too. My TSH is almost non existent and my Free T3 and Free T4 are both low too. When the shortage happened in the fall of 2017. I had enough of the old formulation to get me through five months. Once I started purchasing the new formulation (3/19), everything changed. I didn’t put things together until I read that others were experiencing my exact issues. Has anyone experienced this with the new Naturethroid? If so, how did you handle it?\n",

      "I have been told I have a couple of nodules (including complex nodule - 9mm) that my primary had MRI'd. Nodules discovered in a CT scan after a car accident. I have been trying to get an appointment with the endocrinologist for 3 weeks and this seems to be very long. Is this so minor and not serious that it can just wait like this? Or should I get a different referral? No clue what to do.\n",
      "In the next couple of weeks I'm going to be having a hemithyroidectomy. I've suffered with hyperthyroidism for 3 years as I have a single, large, complex, hot nodule. I've had two fna, and luckily they showed a benign mass. But it's grown, maybe a couple of cm. It was 6cm back in 2015, now it's about 9cm. I was nervous for the surgery so decided to read experiences of a hemithyroidectomy and ended up reading a lot about false negative fna and thyroid cancer with large nodules like mine. But mine is obviously \"toxic\" and I was told that's a good thing. I've had other symptoms for these last years, such as hoarseness and pain, and reactive lymph nodes in the neck. The fna was painful and they withdrew a large amount of blood stained fluid from the nodule in an attempt to decrease the size and for testing, but its complex and the more fluid they removed the more it grew and now its mostly solid and pretty uncomfortable. I can't help thinking this is pretty big and has started growing behind my sternum and it might not be benign after all. My endo did say they won't know for sure until they test it. But most are benign. I know worrying does no good, but I can't help it.\n",
      "Hello! I am a Type 1 diabetic (37yrs) & a hypothyroid victim (19yrs) That being said, I have started getting daily headaches mixed with occasional migraines. I have been on Amour Thyroid for about 1yr now & do feel much-much better than when I was on Synthroid, but my blood work has never been on par. I feel these headaches are thyroid related. So I was considering adding Cytomel back into the 'game' along with the Amour. Here are my latest results: TSH .44 FT4 .71 FT3 4.5 1.25gr Amour Thyroid I have reduced the Amour to 1gr. Will the Cytomel help bring the lows up & lower the FT3? I'm on my 5th doctor now. It is so hard to find one that is willing to go outside of the normal handing out more meds. I take Amour @ 6am every day, but I've noticed consistently at about 1:30'ish (pm) I get heart palpitations. & no is not low blood sugar. I am very active, not overweight & usually very healthy. I rarely get sick. I just am not feeling 'okay', & I want to get rid of these headaches. Just wanted to see if anyone has had similar symptoms. Thank you to all that provide advise.\n",

      "Well from suspicious cells from a slightly grown nodule to receiving that i am high risk from a genetic test, I am scheduled to have a thyroidectomy on December 7th and I am so scared. Supposely the surgeon says its not cancer at this time but the sooner i take it out, the less chance of getting cancer. I am so scared that I won't find the right balance with sinthroid or any of the others. I took sinthroid for like a few days and could not take it. It totally made me feel as though I am going to jump out of my body! I am afraid that I may come down now with all these health issues because my hormones won't adapt from medication. I will be turning 60 shortly. Can anyone share their experience with me please? I am really anxious/nervous. Has anyone gone to a naturopath after a thyroidectomy? Has anyone tried different thyroid hormone replacement that is more natural or easy for the body to adapt compared to sinthroid? Help!\n",

      "Over the past year I have noticed a few changes in my body. The big one is weight gain. I have gained over 30 pounds in a year and I have no idea why. If this happened a few years ago I could tell you it was because of my diet and lack of exercise. However in the past year I have significantly improved my diet and have started exercising more. Yet I gained all this weight and can't seem to get the scale to drop. The next one is fatigue. I am so tired and (again) do not know why. My fiance has expressed concerned with how tired I am. Most days if I could just stay in bed and sleep I would. Coffee has become my best friend. The next is my sex drive. What was there is no longer there. It is causing some tension between my fiance and I. I have noticed a difficulty in concentrating. The fatigue plays a part in that, but even those times I am not tired I find myself making silly mistakes. Many people have suggested getting my thyroid checked. My doctor ordered a TSH and I came out at 3.7 (within the normal range). She never really addressed my other symptoms, but said the weight gain was just my body changing as I got older. I am at my wits end here. I know my levels are in a normal range, but a list of symptoms has all I am experiencing (plus the ones I didn't put on here). I am reaching out to people who have experience with these kinds of disorders. Is normal really normal?\n",

I am wondering at what age any of you started to give the medicine right upon waking and then having your little one wait an hour to eat. This is how he will eventually need to take the medicine. Our doc said as long as he takes it the exact same way everyday, then we don’t need to worry too much about it yet. He currently eats breakfast, waits and hour to get med, and then waits an hour for any kind of snack. It’s getting hard in that waiting for the snack phase if he’s seeing other kids/toddlers eat. But then I wonder if he’s too little to make wait to eat an hour upon waking. Thanks! Lisa\n",

      "In late August, I got bloodwork back after pushing for it...I'm a chronic pain patient (old acct here from lumbar surgery) so some fatigue is just my normal but I felt awful. I had seriously elevated EBV numbers (40 now, mono at 23) which the doc called chronic viral fatigue syndrome. Recommended rest and lots of protein. Did not recheck those... I also was newly diagnosed as hypothyroid. I know my TSH wasn't horrid, but at 5.5 could be better. I started 25mg of levothyroxine. Yesterday the nurse called to say to double up my last remaining dose and that the doc was calling in a 50mg script. I just got the new bloodwork report in the mail. My TSH rose and is now 7.81. Free T3 and T4 w/in range (3.2 and 1.2). Why would the TSH jump? I do have a basic understanding of how the three pieces interact. I don't recall prior numbers on the T3 and T4...though seems like the real goal is managing those and TSH is how the body does that. I understand adjusting and fine tuning take time, but it seems odd that my brain would be yelling even louder when my thyroid is getting some help\n",
      "Hey everyone! I'm being treated for Hypo with Levothyroxine, and have been for maybe a year, or a little less, by my naturopath. It has helped SO much. This is more of a curiosity question than anything else..... I've had heart problems my whole life (I have a few, non serious congenital issues), and ever since being put on Levo, my heart rate has normalized. It doesn't get erratic as often, it feels calmer. My anxiety is better, etc. I always thought that Levo would make my heart rate higher/anxiety worse. It's been a really great and very definite change that my doctor and I are very happy about. Has anyone else had this experience? Also, I'm a fairly small person, 5'3\" and about 125 lbs (I actually gained weight since being treated as I was gaunt before) but my dose is 225mcg, which i've read is high for my weight. But if i take even 1/4 less I get palpitations. Before this my western medicine doc said I had no thyroid problem. It all seems so weird to me, my naturopath clearly has things right as I feel much better. But why so high a dose works for me when my levels were never crazy out of wack is so strange. Anyone else relate?\n",
      "As part of miscarriage/fertility investigations I had my thyroid function tested last year and was told it was 'normal'. I have had it tested a lot in past when presenting symptoms but always came back 'normal'. I am now seeing a new Dr and he advised having them retested again. I will be sending him the results which again I am told are normal, but I am wondering if anyone with more understanding could look at the results and give any opinion. I was concerned that last years FSH was above 2.5 mu/l, although it was still in the normal range I have read that above 2.5 is linked with miscarriage? What is confusing me more is the normal scale is different on both sets of tests, although both show 'normal' my T4 this time would be 'abnormal' if you were to use the scale at the previous lab!

      "Hi everyone: I have been sick for 8 months now. I hope somebody out there will have the patience to read this. 1. I got shingles first 2. At the same time I had a couple of nosebleeds that lasted over 4 hours. 3. Of course I then became anemic 4. After shingles cleared, I got the painful complication afterwards and still have it - post herpetic neuralgia. 5. Also a blood test showed that I have hypothyroidism and I've been trying to get the right dosage now for 5 months. When I first became sick I was very out of breath almost all the time. It was so bad, when I took a shower I wasn't sure I could finish I was having such a hard time breathing. Did the anemia contribute to this, I don't know, but as I got healthier I wasn't so out of breath, although it hasn't gone away completely. Lately I'm out of breath mainly in the morning. I have almost no problem with this in the afternoon or evening and this is what has me so confused. I mean, if it is COPD wouldn't it always bother me? I was prescribed Synthroid about 5 months ago, but 3 times the dosage was lowered. I just got my dose increased about 3 weeks ago and am wondering if it is finally the right dose and maybe that is why I am starting to feel better. Could I be starting COPD or could this breathing trouble be generated by the thyroid problem? I have read a lot on this board about breathing problems with hypothyroidism, but no one mentions needing medication for this. Is an inhaler required, or do we just wait until the right thyroid meds kick in to solve this dilemma. I am a 72 year old female and I did smoke for many years but quit almost a year ago, not that that will change anything. I do realize that if my lungs were damaged, there is no cure, and I must now pay for all those years of smoking. No freebies, right? It has just been a rather difficult time for me lately and I'm hoping someone can offer an opinion or suggestion about what's happening to me and possibly what I can do about it. Thank you so much for your interest.\n",
      "I am going to make this as short and to the point as possible in hopes of getting some advice or maybe clarity on my current thyroid issues, I can't get this off of my mind and am hoping for some encouragement and support to help get me through these next couple of weeks. I am a 25 year old female that was diagnosed with a multi nodular goiter at the age of 16 (my primary care doctor first felt this in my neck upon a routine check up and referred me to a pediatric endocrinologist). I was treatment by a pediatric endocrinologist until I was 18 and then had to be transferred to an adult endo as she could no longer treat me as an adult. Upon my treatment with the pediatric endocrinbologist, she watched the growth and sent me for one FNA biopsy which came back benign. At the time, I had several different sized cysts on the right lobe of my thyroid which were biopsied, all of which came back benign. I had NO nodules on the left lobe of my thryoid. This is in 2012. Fast forward to 2014, the right side of my thyroid and neck had started severly causing me pain, so me endocrinologist opted to remove the right side ONLY as I had no nodules on the left side of my thyroid. I had a partial lobectomy which removed the right side of my thryoid and all of the cysts which were on it, The final pathology after surgery came back benign. Low and behold, just a few short months after having the partial thyroidectomy, a solid nodule appeared during a routine ultrasound check up on the left side of my thyroid. For years my new Endocrinologist has not seemed or acted concerned about this at all and did not even continue ultrasounds or biopsies on this nodule to ensure this wasn't malignant. She took the \"wait and see\" approach, which several times I complained to her or severe neck pain and tenderness and she brushed it off as it was scar tissue from my partial thyroidectomy. The last ultrasound I had showed a 1cm nodule on the left side of my thyroid in April 2016. My doctor once again wanted to wait and see if the size increased. Here, we are September 2018, I switched doctors because I did not feel confident in her \"wait and see\" approach. I had an ultrasound completed on the left side of my neck last week which I have attached the results below, it now shows my nodule has grew to 2 cm. They mentioned that they compared it to previous CT Scans I had completed at the hospital for two automobile accidents and it has grew in size slightly. For a year now I have been having these weird pains in my neck which almost feel like someone is taking a balloon and blowing it up, a feeling of fullness and just a tenderness throughtout my neck. I am now a nervous wreck and severely depressed from researching as it appears you wouldn't have pain until it has spread into your lymph nodes and surrounding bones. I am literally scared to death, I don't think I've ever been this scared in my life. I know google is your own worst enemy when going through this, but from googling this, the report of \"MIXED ECHOGENICITY\" almost always signifies Cancer, as does it having blood flow within the nodule!! I do also know the tiny mass they found at the bottom has not been there in previous scans. I am so confused by this thyroid ultrasound and my doctor was not very informative when he called to give the results. They are referring me back to have a FNA Biopsy soon, I just have the worst feeling about this and am mostly scared to death \"what if\" this nodule has been cancer for years and my doctor just blowed it off? From anyones prior experience, have you had any of these symptoms with cancer and IF it would have been cancer years ago, would it have grew more rapidly that just 1cm to 2cm? IF this were to turn out to be malignant, would it be too late if it has indeed been cancer all of these years since 2015? I will take any experiences/words of advice/encouragement I can get at this point as my family is not supportive at all and acts as is this is nothing when to me this is EVERYTHING. I am a single mother to a 5 year old little girl and am scared to death of this being the worst imaginable. I am having severe anxiety just waiting on a biopsy appointment and cannot eat, sleep or stop these raging thoughts. Thank you all so much in advance and bless you all!! FINDINGS The right lobe is absent. The left lobe measures 5.8 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm. There is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm nodule in the left lobe. It is mixed echogenicity. Color Doppler shows blood flow within it. There is a tiny 3 mm finding at the lower pole of the left lobe Conclusion Dominant solid nodule left thyroid. It may be very slightly larger than on prior CT neck with contrast from 02/24/2014 and it is about the same as on the CT cervical spine from 08/30/2016. Status post right lobectomy.\n",
      "I have 6 nodules in my thyroid after an ultrasound. I’m asymptomatic, no goitre and my labs are normal. I have two in the left lobe approximately 3cmx2cmx2cm classified as heterogeneous with cystic areas and coarse calcification. In the right lobe I have 3 small nodules approx .8cm each and a larger hypoechoic lesion with calcification measuring approximately 1cm. I’m trying to decide if I should go through with the biopsy. I’m terrified it will hurt and I’m not sure it’s needed. I feel like odds are very low of having 6 malignant spots. Anyone else had multiple nodules turn out cancerous?\n",
      "I am a 56 year old female. When I was in my 20's a doctor felt like I could benefit from thyroid medication. He did not do bloodwork at the time. Later I was told my labwork was fine and taken off. More recently another doctor put me on thyroid medication. My TSH was maybe around 3 but then my levels went into hyperthyroid range and she said T3 and T4 were normal so my general internist took me off again. The past couple years I have had steady weight gain, muscle and joint pain, noticeable upper abdomen fat and many other symptoms and my TSH was 4.12 . Should I request more thyroid bloodwork? Could it be something else. I don't want to go on thyroid medication if it is going to make me have hyperthyroidism. New to board so any advise appreciated.\n",
      "Have a Dr. visit coming up and a chance to see a different Dr. in the Endo practice. My Dr. doesn't believe in T3 - only levothyroxine - but I understand that this dr. will prescribe NDT or T3/T4. So I'm trying to figure out if my lab results back up a conversion problem. I have Hashimoto's and am currently taking 125 mcg of levo and have a bunch of ongoing symptoms (constipation/IBS, hair loss, cold feet, edema, low energy, inability to lose weight, distraction, etc). I'm on a low FODMAP diet and take a variety of supplements. Lab results: TSH 2.01 (.4 - 4.5) FT3 2.4 (2.3 - 4.2) FT4 1.1 (.8 - 1.8)\n",
      "A little background info on myself, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and high blood pressure during my pregnancy in early 2016. My doctor put me on Synthroid 50 mcg which I took until September 2017 when I switched doctors and was then placed on Levothyroxine 50mcg. I never noticed any difference or symptoms of having hypothyroidism besides hair loss. Being a new mom, I was always tired and never thought it could be from my thyroids. In February of 2018, I got the flu for the first time in 10 years and then got it a second time a couple of weeks after. Since then it's been a rollercoaster of crazy symptoms such as constant dizziness, brain fog, feeling lightheaded, difficulty concentrating, also had chest pain at one point (could be when my doctor tried to change my blood pressure medicine). My doctor ran several tests and couldn't find anything other than vitamin D deficiency. I've been taking vitamin D3 since April to correct it. I also saw a cardiologist and had a stress test, EKG and echocardiogram due to the chest pain I felt at that time. Everything was normal. Cardiologist said my heart was in great shape. The chest pain eventually went away. Getting frustrated with not getting any answers, I switched doctors a month ago. My new doctor immediately thought about my thyroids after seeing my bloodwork from my previous doctor. My last test with previous doctor was done on 6/04/18 (while still on levothyroxine) with the results of Thyroxine (T4) 9.3 (range 4.5-12.0 ug/dl); Free thyroxine index 3.2 (range 1.2 - 4.9) and TSH 3.020 (range 0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL). I've been researching loads and now know that my FT3 and FT4 should have been checked as well. My current doctor wanted to put me on Armour 60 mg which is definitely something I wanted to try. I started taking it on 8/5/18. Within the first couple of days I noticed a big difference. My dizziness had decreased and I was able to concentrate better. After the 5th day of taking the Armour I started to get heart palpitations only at night while resting. A week later I started to get chest pressure that felt similar to the chest pain I had earlier in the year. I called my doctor and he believed it could be the Armour causing the palpitations. I cut down my dose to 30 mg on 8/18 and within a couple of days the heart palpitations subsided but I still had the chest pressure. Blood was ran on 8/21 (the day on which I was told to take my 30 mcg dose that morning and bloodwork was drawn that evening) FT3 2.8 pg/mL (range 2.2 pg/mL - 4.0 pg/mL); FT4 1.03 ng/dL (range 0.76 ng/dL - 1.46 ng/dL); TSH 5.087 mIU/L (range 0.360 mIU/L - 3.740 mIU/L)(HIGH). My doctor believed that these results were from taking 60 mg and not from the couple of days that I reduced to 30 mg. He wants me to up my dose to 90 mg and retest on 10/1. He doesn't seem too concerned about the chest pressure since I was previously seen by cardiologist a few month ago. I believe he mentioned taking something for indigestion but my pressure doesn't go away after belching. He also wants me to eat organic and start exercising (I'm about 40 lbs overweight). I am slowly increasing my dose to the 90 mg by 15 mg every 10 days. I am currently on 45 mg, no heart palpitations, still have chest pressure but seems to have decreased in intensity. I am terrified that this medicine will give me a heart attack or stroke because of the chest pressure. Any advice?\n",

      "Hi All- I’ve been having a strange symptom lately and wondered if any of you could tell me if this is a familiar thing with your Thyroid issues. About two months ago, started waking up in the mornings feeling my legs were weak and shaky on the inside...nothing I could physically feel outside. It would usually last all day, but at times would randomly go away for a few hours or half a day. That has been consistent for two months. Then, about 2 weeks ago, I started getting numbness and tingling in my left leg and my right forearm and hand (first my leg for 4h, then my arm a couple days later for an hour or two). After that, my leg numbness and tingling has returned once for a couple hours...but my hand and forearm has remained feeling weak and different. It feels like after your hand falls asleep and starts to wake up...kind of slow and harder to move. I’m able to move it and use it fine, but the feeling is very odd. As a side note, my arm continues to fall asleep several times a night when I sleep with my usual hand under my pillow position (which has never happened before). So, I don’t know if my hand feeling is reacting to having that happen all night. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Anyone had this with thyroid issues? Especially, located to one or two extremities? I should also mention, I had a 2 or 3mm nodule found 8 months ago and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (TSH level 4.57) at that time. I was placed on Levothyroxine 50mcg at the time and checked 3 months later (TSH 2.34). Lost my health insurance until this Saturday, so I haven’t been able to check for any changes. Could my thyroid levels change that drastically to cause me issues in 5 months? Could the module be growing and causing issues? This muscle thing is kinda freakin me out! Please respond! 🙏🏻\n",

      "I had a 24hr thyroid uptake test the other day, and Zwanger just posted my results... 37.2%, and the written diagnosis on the report is hyperthyroidism. But it doesn't list any ranges. Not a big surprise, but I'm just curious what the normal range is? Googling it and I see all sorts of numbers... 25% or less... or 30% or less... Does it differ for men and women, or weight? Guess I'm just curious if my result is semi-borderline or definitely into the hyper range?\n",
      "For many years I have had the symptoms of hypo. It runs on my moms side of the family. Her mom had it but although my mother has the same symptoms she's never been diagnosed. I had my thyroid checked back in 2008 and the dr told me my levels were normal. I do not remember what it was at that time but I do recall it was the T3 test. I started researching more on hypo recently and read how the full panel needs to be done in ordered to get a proper diagnosis. So I called up my new Dr and asked if they did this which I was told yes. I get it done and recieved my labs today and see that it was only the T3 (free) that was tested. It was 3.2 and the dr tells me this is lower than he likes it and prescribes me medication. I started rereading through the sites I'd bookmarked and I'm very confused here. I read t3 is best to diagnose hyper and you need the tsh test to diagnose hypo?? I'm going to call them tomorrow but I have a feeling they'll tell me this is their standard testing. Does anyone know whether this t3 test is actually even giving me any answers? Thanks!\n",

      "Hi everyone, I’be been having what seems to be hypothyroid symptoms for about two years now (weight gain, tired, bad constipation, dry skin, irregular months, etc.) Not doctor so far has given me the time of day about my concerns since my TSH always comes back “perfectly normal”. The other day my thyroid started to swell, enough my coworkers asked what was wrong, and my gyn also pointed it out at my annual. Within a few days it went down but is still enlarged. I was ordered an ultrasound which found a benign colloid cyst (3mm). I was referred to an ENT. I have a family history of hoshimotos and just want to cover my bases as they also had a very hard time getting diagnosed. Does this sound like a thyroid problem? Or is the cyst have nothing to do with the symptoms? Thanks!\n",

Family history of multiple relatives with Hashimotos as well. Recently my gyno told me my thyroid seemed swollen. Over the next few days it had gotten very clearly swollen (enough my coworker noticed) then periodically would go back down. Again, my bloodwork (TSH only this time) was normal “right in the middle” I was told. Any thoughts on if there is or isn’t a thyroid problem? Is it something else causing it to swell?

      "Years ago I was diagnosed as having Hashimoto's... with a high-normal TSH, but somewhat enlarged (and bumpy) thyroid and elevated antibodies. I was put on 50mcg of unithroid basically just to keep nodules from forming. Recently I haven't been feeling so great, and my results came back with a TSH of .07, high-normal T3/T4 and elevated TSI antibodies (think they were around 400) with slightly elevated Hashi antibodies too. So does this mean I have both Hashimoto's and Graves? My thyroid scan shows no nodules, but with minor enlargement of the gland. Can TSI be high for other reasons besides Graves? I do have a number of matching symptoms however, even without my T3/T4 being technically high.\n",
      "I am a 46 year old female. I had a biopsy this week on my thyroid. A nodule was discovered by accident on an MRI. An ultrasound revealed 4 nodules on my right thyroid. 3 are small, 1 is 2.13 cm, some hypoechoic features, some solid, and some microcalcifications. I'm scared to death because I've read that microcalcifications make it more likely to be cancer. I have no symptoms, can't feel the nodule, my thyroid hormone levels are normal, and no antibodies for hashimotos. I had my iodine levels tested and they are low, although not extreme. I'm panicking really badly and I have to wait several more days for my results. Any reassurance would be appreciated. Please no responses if yours was cancer. I need to feel some hope.

My bloodwork seems to be coming back normal, however I'm still having so many symptoms of being hypo (I was also having them before surgery but now they are even worse). Before surgery I gained 35 pounds in one year, and I've been slowly gaining more after surgery as well.

      "Hi ya'll. I've been working with my Dr for some time now, because of constant forgetfulness, always tired ever increasing weight gain (in 2001 I was 180Lbs, now in 2018, I'm nearly 300Lbs), I don't eat as much as I used to, I keep telling my wife not to cook large portions, I only have 1 medium meal a day with smaller snacks of 1 or 2 lettuce and tomato sandwiches, and a few cloves of raw garlic, throughout the day, I don't touch alcohol of any kind, if I drink soda it's always diet, I very rarely drink coffee, (last time was about 3 months a ago), I used to exercise a lot and walk everywhere, but over the past year, my metabolism has been literally taking a nose dive, and my libido? Well, if it could be measured it would register -15,000 lol, and also, I'm losing my hair like there's no tomorrow, and the biggest problem I've come across is translating words into written text, IE,,,,I'm heavily relying on spell checkers to even write this message, because even though I know what I'm typing, I'm spelling the words as If I'm dyslexic, and I was never like this before. So, now I had my lab tests and everything else was normal, except TSH, the range for the test is 0.45 - 4.50, and my result was 8.25, so now I'll be taking synthroid later today for the first time, and hopefully, all this should disappear.\n",
      "I was shocked a few months ago when told my blood test showed a high number concerning my thyroid ...it was a 9. so the higher the number means your thyroid is low. so my dr put me on generic Synthroid 25mcg. he told me it wasn't much. I took it for about 2mos. then one day I woke up hurting so bad I couldn't stand it. and one time I woke crying. I was hurting on the left side of my body, esp. my left shoulder blade. over time it spread and my left arm hurt really bad. I went to a nurse practitioner and she said I must have pulled a muscle. so she said to take pain meds and some muscle relaxer. it didn't work and I couldn't take it. I got off right away. I expected it to stop hurting. it didn't. it took a long time on the pain killer I was using, so I started taking aleve and it worked. I took the muscle relaxer on occasion. I stayed off and the pain began to subside but very slowly. then I saw another dr during the time off but still in pain and he did xrays and saw nothing. that was it. well, by that time I wasn't hurting but I had gained 2pounds. I then started getting scared I would get fatter. so I got back on. ive been on abt 2wks and the pain started again. its bad. my entire left arm hurts so bad. this morning I decided I didn't want to hurt that bad so I got off. I quit cold turkey...but im not on much ...I hope this pain doesn't take a long time to stop. I made an appointment with my regular dr. I have only been seeing nurse practitioners...who don't know what is going on and only guessing. I had to find out for myself. its why I got back on and am feeling the same pain. I wonder what else I can take. im sure my dr will let me know. I have never ever had thyroid problems ...this is a first...or if I did no one ever knew about it...im huge..im way over weight...normally I have energy but not when im in this much pain. I am responsible for my mother who has alzheimers and my husband who had cancer so my stress level is up there plus im going to move...to another city. let me know anything you can.\n",
      "A little history: In 2014 when I was 16, I had an ultrasound done on my neck & they found a 3 mm partially cystic & partially solid nodule on my left lobe. They never asked me to come back in for a follow up or a repeat ultrasound in a year to check it again. Flash forward to May 2016, I was having some neck swelling so I went back. Thyroid ultrasound showed a 2nd partially cystic partially nodule on my right lobe that was 3mm. My original nodule had grown to 4mm. Bloodwork didn't show any thyroid problems. I'm now 20; I've started chocking on my food more frequently and always feel like there's something in the back of my throat. I plan on going back to my doctor this week and she will send me for another thyroid ultrasound. But i'm wondering if there's something for concern? I've also been extremely tired. I don't think these nodules could've grown to a size where they'd be causing my newer throat symptoms, but what else would?\n",
      "Hi, I am a healthy 56 year old female. Over the past few years I’ve experienced an increase in days of being really washed out feeling “malaise” for lack of a better word. It’s a significant change. I often have difficulty concentrating, frequent tinnitus, days of feeling short of breath, very dry skin, thinning hair through the temples, constipation, off and on days of vague muscle aches, resting heart rate of 54, and an increase in migraines. Out of the blue I’ll have a spell where it feels like my nervous system gets switched on- I’ll feel “racy” yet it isn’t anxiety; I’m certain of that. Very strong family history of thyroid disease, maternal side. Mom, aunt, female cousins. There are more symptoms that wax and wane, but this is the short list. I’ve been tested for lung function, heart, brain MRI/MRA-all normal. I am slender, exercise daily, but feel terrible much of the time anymore. Pinned it on menopause, or migraines for awhile but the heavy-headed weariness just seems to be hanging on. My baseline energy level is very high, so this is not normal for me. I feel unmotivated if that makes sense. I’m not depressed, however my mood does seem to dip slightly for a day or two as these symptoms worsen. My TSH has typically been 1.1-1.2 but recently jumped to 1.63 My doctor is taking these symptoms seriously and retested. Current labs showed: TSH: 1.2- (range .450-4.50) Free T3: 2.3 (range 2.0-4.4) Free T4: .98 (range .82-1.77) I had ultrasound of thyroid and have several small nodules and cysts. Next will be scan to see if any are hot. Antibodies are being tested- one came back normal, one is pending. My questions are: do these lab results point toward hypo? Could the occasional racy nervous feeling in my body (feels like my nerves are in a storm) be caused by thyroid dysfunction as well? The fact that I am slender doesn’t seem to fit hypothyroid but some symptoms do. I’m perplexed. Any guidance would surely be appreciated!\n",
      "Hello, I found out I had hypothyroid last summer when bloodwork showed my tsh was 15 and my free t4 was 0.9. I have been on synthroid this past year and have been on the same dose since November-ish. I just got my bloodwork back as I haven’t been feeling the best, and my results are: Tsh is 0.33, free t4 is 1.03 T3 (not sure free or total?) is 2.9 (range 2.4-4.2 they said). Since I had a higher tsh when the problem was first found, I don’t know that they suspected any pituitary issue. I did not test positive for any hashimoto’s at the time. Any thoughts why my tsh would be low and my t4 not higher? Should I be thinking about pituitary? Thanks.\n",

      "Brief background- 23 year old female with a family history of thyroid cancer. About three weeks ago I had blood work done and everything was normal except my TSH levels were 0.799. My GP doesn’t seem to think there is an issue with this but I’m extremely concerned because my levels are lower than my Mother’s were when she found out she had thyroid cancer. Furthermore I’ve had a feeling like there’s something kind of stuck in my throat. Not painful, but more of an aggravation. I can not get an ultrasound done on my neck without orders from my GP. Am I just overthinking this because of my family history or could this really be something I need to be concerned with?! Help!!\n",
      "Dear, Once iron levels are optimized, do we have to take less NDT? It seems I've gone hyper since correcting ferritin-levels yet I'm at the same dose as before.\n",
      "I started having Hyper symptoms (mainly fatigue) this February, went to the doc, and these were my thyroid testing results: March '18 TSH: 0,008 FT4: 2,53 Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO): higher than 1.500 Thyroglobulin antibodies: 232.1 TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb): 9.17 The doc gave me a Graves Disease diagnosis, though I lacked characteristic symptoms such as a goiter and eye disease. He put me on Methimazole 30mg. I took it and felt a slight improvement for a while before my symptoms took a turn for the worse, the fatigue intensified, and I started having Hypo symptoms such as weight gain, muscle cramps and aches, depression,etc. By May, I took some tests again. The results were such: May '18 TSH: 0,22 FT4: 0,62 He lowered the dosage to 10 mg which I took for a month before getting tested again. By June my Hypo symptoms got worse. Jun '18: TSH: 21,40 FT4: 0,85 I was taken off Methimazole, and got tested again mid July. I now have some mild Hyper symptoms again. These are my July results, showing mild Hyperthyroidism: July '18: TSH: 0,06 FT4: 1,37. Does anyone have any clue as to why I was thrown into Hypo so fast with Methimazole? And why am I oscillating between Hyper/Hypo like this?\n",
      "I just had a thyroid panel done and need help interpreting. My Dr. only will do TSH, so I did the full panel independently. Thank you for any advice.

Is this an issue? It mentions that sometimes it can be elevated due to exposure to animals (I have pets, but I'm not allergic.).\n",
      "Hi, I recently visited my Dr. complaining of anxiety, irritability, and attention issues, I am an adult male in my mid 40's. Upon examination, he said he wanted to test my thyroid levels. He measured free T4 & free T3. The T3 came back a little evelated. If the top of the range was 4.2, mine was 4.9. He ordered an radioactive T3 uptake test, my 6 hour and 24 hour uptake levels were a little elevated. for the 6 hour I think I was at 18, and 24 hour I was 40. He immediately wanted me to go on a 4 week regimen of propylthiouracil 200mg / day (100 twice daily). I did a lot of reading on it, and a lot of what I found seems to indicate that a slightly elevated free T3 in the presence of normal T4 isn't a huge cause for concern. Have others been in (or treated) a similar situation and what was the course of action? I don't like the idea of forcing my thyroid levels down and being lethargic as a result if it is unnecessary. I have been under a tremendous amount of stress due to major changes in my professional and personal life, and if I can get things under control by managing my stress levels, I'd much rather do that than deal with longer term issues related to a medication that I may not really need. Any thoughts / opinions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n",
      "Hi everyone, I am starting this thread to post some information that may be helpful to you. TF\n",
      "Hi, All, I've had abnormal levels of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies for about 20 years (level about 210 with normal range less than 20), but no one would treat it until my TSH became higher than the normal range (of course). I went on Synthroid and felt horrible, then my doctor put me on Armour. I didn't feel any better and my free T3 and free T4 were always abysmal. At one point I was taking FIVE grains of Armour and my levels were still terrible (Free T4 was .9, with range of .8-1.9, and Free T3 was about 2.3, with range of 2.2-4.2), but my TSH was near zero. After a few years of this, I said \"Screw This!\" about 2 years ago and stopped taking any thyroid med at all without telling my doctor (not smart, I know). I figured I must not really have a thyroid problem after all. After stopping the med, I felt basically the same (terrible). Last month, my doctor insisted on checking my levels, and, unbelievably, my Free T3 and Free T4 levels are way better than they were when I was taking 5 grains of Armour (Free T3 2.9, Free T4 1.42, same ranges as above)!! He also agreed to check my Reverse T3, which was 24.9 (normal range 9.0-27.0), so \"normal\". He just said to keep taking the same dose, not knowing that I hadn't taken any meds in two years. Does anybody know why I'd have better results off thyroid meds than on them? Also, even though my Reverse T3 is high normal, could this have any effect on the results? Thanks for your help!! M\n",

      "Autoimmune? Thyroid? Parathyroid? Cancer? Pre-Diabetes? My main questions are at the bottom. History: 32 y/o white female. 5'8\" 128lbs, very active lifestyle. Self employed and recently divorced so yes, I have had a lot of stress. Growing up, I had many episodes of strep throat then had tonsils removed at age 16. I've also had frequent UTI's my whole life and was diagnosed with IC but surprisingly, those episodes have become much more infrequent. 4 years ago and after several gall bladder attacks, I went to the ER and they removed it. I've had several \"gall bladder attacks\" since then but they weren't quite as painful and were over quickly. Senior year, I had severe pain and stiffness in my hands. I couldn't even pick up a gallon of milk Dr. gave a steroid shot and it went away. I've had a few minor episodes with this off and on over the years. My other long standing complaint would be SI pain. It started 11 years ago when I got pregnant with my one and only child. I also ride horses for a living so that could be the cause I suppose. ----------------------------------------------------------- Over the last 2.5 years my symptoms have gotten worse. My hair has been thinning badly, my skin has gone crazy with dryness and ingrown hairs, sores that take forever to heal. Bumps started showing up on the sides of my fingers. I thought they were warts and tried everything to remove them. They fluctuate in size but started getting more and more. Then they started to show up on the palmar surface of my fingers in clusters near the joint creases. Slightly larger red ones started to show up in my finger tips that were painful. Since December 2017, my symptoms have exploded. If I had to only pick one horse to bet on, it would be Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder because I have so many symptoms of multiple autoimmune diseases. Thankfully, I've been taking pictures and notes to show my doctors because my blood work is within \"normal ranges\" for everything except my low positive ANA (1:160 speckled and homogenous) so they aren't in any big hurry to figure out what is wrong with me. They are baffled by my symptoms and definitely suspect something autoimmune and are still running tests. However, I can't afford to be like this. I'm self employed! I need to figure this out and FAST. -My fatigue has gotten so bad that even my full dose of 40mg of Adderall taken all at once with 3 cups of coffee didn't even touch it.. I should've been bouncing off the walls! I feel soo tired but can't sleep more than 5-6 hours. -The brain fog is getting sooo bad. I forget what I'm saying in the middle of a sentence, almost brushed my teeth with diaper rash cream ect.. -I'm always freezing cold. I've noticed my body temp has been hovering around 97 -97.6. - My muscles ache, wasting away, getting weaker, muscle twitching is getting worse. - Burning/tingling/numbness radiates distally when pressure is applied to thin skin areas like the top of my foot/hand, inner elbow, and armpit. - More bumps popping up all over my body. - I get dizzy every time I stand up. Blood pressure and heart rate are all over the place without doing anything but sitting here. - Heart burn is getting worse and my chest has been feeling a bit heavy... -Last weekend I had a really bizarre and intense pain like my pelvis was in a vice squeezing my hips together. It lasted about 4 hours and dissipated.. it hasn't happened again yet. -I scratched a bug bite on the medial side of my bicep very lightly and it turned into a large 1.5\" hicky looking red/purple petechial bruise. Soo with that said, here are my lab results so far: High side of normal is bold. Low side of normal is underlined. Hormones: TSH - 1.06 (.40-4.50) T3- 98 (76-181) FT4- 1.4 (.8-1.8) Vit D - 32 (30-100 Normal, 20-29 Insufficiency, <20 deficient) Would you consider this low side of normal? I basically live outside, in Texas and eat/drink food fortified with it too. CBC/Metabolic: RBC- 5.10 (3.8-5.10) WBC- 7.3 (4-11) Hemoglobin- 14.9 (11.5-15.5) Hematocrit- 42.7 (34-45) MCV- 82.7 (80-100) MCH-28 (27-34) MCHC-35.3 (32-35.5) RDW- 11.4 (11-15) Glucose - 86 (70-99) Sodium - 142 (133-146) Potassium - 3.8 (3.5-5.4) Chloride- 105 (95-107) Carbon Dioxide- 29 (19-31) This went up 2 points after I QUIT smoking? Calcium- 9.9 (8.5-10.5) Went up .3 in 3 months. Protein-7.3 (6.1-8.3) Albumin-5.0 (3.5-5.2) Calc Globulin- 2.1 (1.9-3.7) (other values were in the middle) Immunology: ESR - 2 (0-20) CCP - <16 (<20) CRP - .4 (<8.0) RF - <10 (<14) ACE - 40 (9-67) Chromatin, SS A/B, Jo-1, Centromere B, Scl-70, Sm/RNP = Negative. Still waiting on results for Complement C3/C4/CH50, Histone, 14.3.3 Protein. X-rays of the hands show very mild arthritis and my SI/lumbar x-ray showed pretty significant arthritis in my right SI joint (the one that always hurts more). No other imaging done yet. ---------------------------------------------- All my symptoms scream autoimmune. However, no family history really. I had an uncle with RA and a niece with Psoriasis. All my AI labs except for the ANA are normal. My family does have a strong history of type 2 diabetes (Paternal grandma, my dad, and his 5 brothers/sisters all had it by the time they were 45. Some were skinny and some were slightly overweight). Paternal Grandpa died of a heart attack. My dad had a quadruple bypass almost 4 years ago. He's also had stage 2 Melanoma. My maternal Grandma passed away 3 years ago from breast cancer. My mom and grandma both had hysterectomies in their late 30's because of large uterine fibroids. My mom has also had a few small benign tumors removed from both her feet. Some calcified, others were not. With all that being said, I feel like maybe there is still hope that it's something else non-autoimmune and have been researching non-stop. QUESTIONS: Elevated RBC, slightly elevated and trending up Calcium, and dropping vit D, could this be parathyroid related? They haven't checked my PTH level yet. Should I even bother asking? They haven't tested other fat soluble vitamin levels but there could be a malabsorption issue after my gallbladder was removed right? I have been supplementing with vitamin D for the last week, and my symptoms haven't really improved. What's the average time it takes to see any improvement after you start supplementing? I've also been doing weekly b12 injections since March, and have been trying to drink a lot more water and haven't seen really any improvement (physically or in my labs from January to now). I was thinking that maybe it was adderall aggravated. I took only 20mg today, no caffeine, and muscle twitching happened in my left upper lip and right arm near my shoulder... both places I've never had muscle twitching before!!! The joint pain also started long before I was ever prescribed adderall. The other reason I think it could possibly be endocrine related is blue/black/greenish watery nipple discharge. Dr didn't seem concerned since it was bilateral and only when pressure is applied to the breast. She did check my prolactin level and it was normal. Any ideas or advice???? sorry for the super long post. I'm desperate!\n",
      "In May of last year, I went to a new doctor. At our first visit, when she was ordering routine labs, I asked if she could check my thyroid. I told her some of the symptoms that I was having and I started crying as I told her that my main concern was my weight. In about 2 1/2 years I had put on about 30-35lbs, all while actively trying to lose. No matter what I do I can not lose weight, and the worst part is that I keep gaining. I told her all of the diets that I have tried and she agreed that it was most likely my thyroid. She felt a nodule and ordered an ultrasound as well as the bloodwork. I felt so optimistic walking out of her office that day. A week after getting the blood work and the ultrasound, her nurse left me a message. It went something like this: \"The nodule is benign, but she wants you to get another ultrasound in 6 months. Your thyroid levels all came back normal, but she wants you to get retested in 3 months. She is concerned about the antibodies, which usually indicates an autoimmune disease. Also, your cholesterol is kind of high, so she would like for you to lose a few pounds\". :/ So fast forward a year later, and I am still trying unsuccessfully to lose weight, and in fact have put on another 10-15lbs(I am only 5 feet tall so these 45 extra pounds really show on me). A month or so ago I sent her a message and told her that I'm still having the weight issue, as well as other symptoms and I asked if there is anything else that she can check for. She basically said that she tested everything that she could and that women my age (45) tend to put on weight and have trouble losing. I feel like she just completely dismissed me. I don't understand how she can say that it definitely sounds like thyroid...she was concerned about the nodule...concerned about the antibodies...but the numbers came back and she just basically tells me that I'm old and I have to deal with it. I will post my lab results, and I understand that they are in the normal range, but I feel horrible. It's making me so depressed. My clothes don't fit. I can't even wear my wedding rings anymore. I just want someone to help me instead of just looking at numbers on a piece of paper. I know that something is not right with my body. I eat well...I exercise almost daily. I should not be steadily gaining weight. Anyway...here are my labs from May 2017 and August 2017. For some reason they either didn't do the antibodies at the August test, or it just wasn't on my patient portal thing. August 2017 labs TSH 2.600 uIU/mL 0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL Triiodothyronine (T3) 124 ng/dL 71 - 180 ng/dL T4,Free(Direct) 1.20 ng/dL 0.82 - 1.77 ng/dL May 2017 Triiodothyronine (T3) 118 ng/dL 71 - 180 ng/dL TSH 1.970 uIU/mL 0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab 33 IU/mL 0 - 34 IU/mL THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODY 29.7 IU/mL 0.0 - 0.9 IU/mL T4,Free(Direct) 1.16 ng/dL 0.82 - 1.77 ng/dL\n",

      "Hi. I’m new here. I don’t have health insurance and I have been going to a free clinic. I had blood work twice. The first round indicated that my TSH level was low. At 0.331. Second round was for testing of free T3 and T4 levels. Those came back within normal range, and TSH was 0.271 that time. I also had my TSI done and it just said <0.10. The thing is the nurse I am seeing doesn’t know anything about thyroids. I had an ultrasound of my thyroid also. It indicated thyromegaly (moderate) and a 2mm tiny cyst with no hard masses. She just told me I have hyperthyroidism. No medication and I can’t take beta blockers because low BP at 90/42. HR at 63. I also have terrible palpitations (PVCS) I’m tired all the time, and also have mitral valve prolapse. So my question is could I have Graves?

      "Hello, I've not been diagnosed with a thyroid-related disorder but am here because I suspect one due to my ongoing symptoms, and I'm wondering if I can get some guidance on what to ask my doctor next. -Itching all over for the last 2 years -Feeling of harder to swallow than normal for the last 3 years -More than normal fatigue for the last 1 year (thought it was normal as I'm a 33 year old mother of twin toddlers) 6 weeks ago (a week after weaning from breastfeeding): -Sudden increase in itchiness on upper back/chest, neck and scalp -Several lymph nodes swelled up on right side, then over the weeks a few more above collarbone and other side of neck (no signs or symptoms of infection or illness) -Increase in fatigue and lack of focus/concentration 2 weeks ago: -Hair started coming out more than usual -Bald spot on top right of my head the size of a nickel Last week on Monday I went to the doctor and she did several tests for mono, cmv, abc, metabolic, etc, all negative. Did a TSH which came out normal (1.36). Sent me for a neck ultrasound, the results of which I noticed online today: -It says there is no concern about the lymph nodes although a few are more than 1cm and palpable -Thyroid gland: Right lobe: 5.3 x 1.4 x 1 cm, mildly heterogeneous, contains a 7 x 4 x 7 mm sharply circumscribed hypoechoic solid nodule, smoothly marginated, wider than tall, moderately vascular, contains single coarse echogenic shadowing focus, TI-RADS score 5/class IV. Left lobe: 4.3 x 1.3 x 1 cm, mildly heterogeneous, no focal abnormality. Isthmus: 2 mm, no focal abnormality. The doctor hasn't called me so I'm assuming it's nothing urgent, but I'm a little concerned about the nodule as I've heard TI-RADS score of 5 should be suspicious (don't worry, I will follow up with her about it). My questions are: Does a thyroid result like this during an US indicate what could be causing my symptoms? Has anyone had similar symptoms and later been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder? Could it just be hormones resettling after breastfeeding? And what should I be asking my doctor next time I go in, to rule out thyroid issues as the cause of my symptoms?

      "Heres the deal. Ive only had one doctor in my life who looked at my symptoms and said I needed to be medicated. That while my levels were \"normal\" by standards that this doesnt tell the whole story. I felt fine on a low dose of levothyroxine. Well Ive moved away from the doctor that listened to me and my current doctors tells me that I just need to eat more. I have a goiter. I have nodules on my thyroid I keep asking my doctors to do a COMPLETE panel I see now I only got T4 and TSH T4 0.98 TSH 3.07 I am 41 I quit breast feeding in November of 2017 I have ZERO sex drive.

My doctor just keeps telling me my symptoms are because I dont consume enough calories. Yet my weight is at a normal level. In fact if Im not hyper-vigilant about calories I gain. He considers my attention to calories an issue. Except if I dont maintain that I binge eat. Which is another issue unrelated that I plan to discuss with him. Am I just crazy? Do my test results warrant a second look? Ive also been diagnosed with adhd and never been medicated when I go back to the doctor Im going to ask for vyvanse.

      "So I've been scouring the internet for answers to this question, found this awesome forum and decided to join. Recently noticed my hair is thinning at my hairline and toward my center part. I'm a 32 year old female with tons of hair, so this is understandably very upsetting. I immediately went in and my PCM ran some bloodwork (most of which I requested). The two red flag items are TSH: 3.07 (lab reference range was like .5- 3.7 normal) Vitamin D: 28 (I believe the reference range was 30-something) Now, she wants to refer me to dermatology. And when I talked to the nurse earlier (somehow it is so difficult to get in touch with the PCM) she told me I'd have to discuss a different referral with the PCM because she couldn't do it. I don't even think I got a dermatology referral out of that conversation because I was making a fuss about the TSH. My main question... I guess, is the TSH level worth further investigation? Could it be the source of my hair loss? Or should I go the dermatology route first? Oh, I have had my thyroid checked in the past, some 2-3 years ago. TSH was around 1.4 or so. Thanks guys for reading and any insight.\n",
      "I had my thyroid removed when I was about 19. Don't know if they took it all out or half. Am now in my 70's. Do I still have to take thyroid medicine? Am taking Levothyroxine. The reason I ask is that I have lost so much hair. My hair is very very thin. You can see the scalp. Am wondering if it's the thyroid medicine that has caused the hair loss or it's because I don't have the thyroid gland. Have thought of going to the doctor but, thought I would ask here first. Thank you\n",
      "I repeatedly have very low TSH levels, but low to midrange free T4 and T3 levels. I have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism, not hyper, but my Dr. keeps insisting on lowering my doses of L-thyroxine and Cytomel. I am gaining significant weight and can barely function because of fatigue. My bowels would move once a week if I didn't take a laxative daily. My hair is dry and wirey, brittle, my memory is shot, I feel like a sloth trying to just move around my house and function. My current doses are L-thyroxine 88 mcg, Cytomel 15 mcg/d. I have documented hypothyroidism since 1990. Current labs on these doses: TSH: 0.018 (0.45-4.5), free T4 1.10 (0.82-1.77) and free T3 3.1 (2.0-4.4). Does anyone have any ideas why my TSH runs so low? I do have autoimmune disease, systemic lupus and RA. I have no symptoms of pituitary insufficiency, but have not been checked for that.\n",

      "Hi Everyone, I recently started getting under eye swelling out of no where. It has happened about 4 times over the past 6 months. My eyes get really watery, they become very swollen (almost like I've been punched in the eye)- mostly under my eye - and become a bit itchy. I have seen a doctor 2x and I do not have an eye infection. They keep telling me it is an allergic reaction to something. I find that hard to believe as I have not changed my make up or lotions, ect. It occurred to me that it could be related to my HYPOthyroidism. My labs were a bit off recently. I do best when my TSH is around 1 and I tend to get symptoms when it is near 2 or above and it is 2.6 right now (as well as frees being a bit off too). Have any of you experienced this and what helps? Thanks!\n",
      "I am wondering if anybody is or had a similar situation? I am a 65 year old woman. I’ve been on medication for Hypothyroidism for 35 years! No other health problem other than for the last 15 years on a low dose of high blood medication (Lisinopril 10 MG) 8 month ago I became nauseous daily, unable to eat and thinking I had the flu. After a couple weeks went to the doctor because I lost 20 pounds! Began taking every test available for stomach and digestive problems. All test came back normal! I stopped taking all supplements or anything else other than my 2 daily prescriptions. After 2 months I stopped taking my thyroid medication because I couldn’t think of anything else to do and I was desperate! This was against doctors advice! I stopped feeling nauseous!! After 6 month without taking medication...my thyroid test NORMAL! At this point my daily life has never been worse! I am up most of the night with spiking blood pressure and high supposedly resting heart rate. Have never been to Emergency room and ended up there last month with a panic attack with vitals 190/120/150! If I take to much blood pressure meds to get my pressure down in the middle of night, my blood pressure is dangerously low during the day. I am on a low dosage of Effexor (37.5) for panic attacts...does not help my nightly high BP or sleepless nights! I was also prescribed clonidine to immediately bring my BP down when it spikes! I finally got a referral to see an internist but the next appointment is July 3rd! Will I last that long to ‘maybe’ get answers?\n",
      "I finally got the results back for my most recent bloodwork and now I'm so confused! Can anyone help me interpret these results: TSH: 0.68 (0.40-4.50 mIU/L) FT4: 0.9 (0.8-1.8 NG/DL) T3 uptake 20.8 (22.0-35%) I have so many of what I now realize are symptoms. I have been being treated for anxiety disorders, meanwhile, my levels are goofy. I have been begging for tests for so long but my PCP always just tests the TSH and says I'm \"in range\". I feel awful every day! I'm so over it! Thanks!\n",
      "I've been on hyperthyriodism treatment for nearly 1 years. At first, I recovered 20lbs from the weight that I've loss. Lately, it kept increasing so I took the gym to balance my weight. However, there's little hope cause I still remained growing weight though I developed the muscle as well. I have intention to use CLA to reduce the weight, any recommendation??? Is there any side effects or harms on the gland when using CLA? Thanks !\n",
      "I just had CBC done as part of a proactive health check through the school district that I work for. My TSH has gone up to 3.26 (still within normal range). I have felt very hypothyroid for the last 8 years. I’m attaching my last post and blood work from July that has my full story and and complete list of labs. Before that my TSH was tested in Dec. and was .86. What is going on? I have never tested positive for thyroid antibodies, but was positive for autonuclear antibodies on an ANA panel. I do have a heterogenous, course in echotexture goitre that seems to be larger with each new ultrasound. One doctor thought lupus was possible, but I don’t have the classic mylar rash. He retired...sigh. All others say all is normal and well. But I feel awful. I spent November to March trying to recover from a severe respiratory and sinus infection. I still run low grade fever every day 99-100. What is up!?!? What is most weird to me is that I’m getting recurrent bladder/kidney infections, have extremely cloudy urine, extreme water retention, puffy eyes and face AND my latest blood work is showing that I’m very slightly anaemic, and some slightly abnormal blood work with my kidneys and liver. I’m just going to include the abnormal readings along with my much higher than normal TSH. TSH 3.26 mI units/mL (.34-5.00) MCHC 32.1 LOW g/dL (33-37) MPV 10.6 HIGH fL (7.4-10.4) BUN 24 HIGH mg/dL (6-20) Creatinine .67 LOW mg/dL (.7-1.20) Bili total .2 mg/dL (.3-1.2) OLD POST FROM JULY: I have had hypothyroid symptoms following the birth of my 2nd child in 2010 (so for about 7 years). I am 20 lbs over my \"normal\" weight. My hair is shedding badly. Very tired, allergies and asthma are out of control, getting chronic UTI and kidney infections, diagnosed with IBS-C, getting ready to have my 2nd sinus surgery, aches and pains etc. So far my ENT has been ordering my labs. Saw an endocrinologist once who said my levels were all normal, but wants to just retest me every year for a suspicion of Hashimotos. My goiter is \"course in echtexture\"....his only explanation for that was that my immune system was likely attacking it. I'm confused. All my Labs are normal, but with all the talk of \"optimal\" levels, does anyone see anything from these labs that could be causing my symptoms? They tell me I'm normal, but I'm always sick and tired and don't feel normal. TSH 1.84 UIU/ml.

      "Had Graves disease took Tapazole for few years till t3 t4 levels were normal then stopped tapazole and TSH went from 0.0005 to .500. Also took beta blockers for tachycardia 180 bpm but had reaction from them, called reversible hypoglycemia . It took 3 years of me going to the E.R when I felt nervous, jittery, hyper thoughts, hyperhidrosis, anxiety. The doctors never put it together that the new symptoms were caused by the new medication. Even though it's documented educational text that I came across that beta-blockers may cause reversible hypoglycemia. I also had seizures due to glucose and sodium levels going to low or non-existent . It have not felt this way in months but since the temperature went above 70 degress I got these symptoms twice within two weeks. My hdl is high but others are with in range . I hydrate and eat prior to walking. When I still had hyperthyroidism a lot of hormones were abnormal, but I noticed that when my Progesterone levels became with in range, Anxiety wasn't as bad\n",
      "Hi, I’m all new to this. I recently had what my doctor thinks is a relapse remitting multiple sclerosis episode, I was sent for blood tests and due to be sent for nerve conduction studies. She wanted to test my thyroid and she tested for TSH and Serum free t4. My results are as our lab states within normal range. The TSH range of normal is 0.3-5.5. Mine is 4.7. The serum free t4 normal is 10-22. Mine is 16pmol. I’m in the UK so I don’t know if this sounds right or not? Can anyone enlighten me? Thanks!\n",
      "Can Hoshi’s be dx by an U/S alone? I have a small nodule and the report came in stating that is is “highly suspicious of Hoshimoto’s Thyroiditis”. I have almost all of the symptoms (fatigue, depression, zero libido, heavy periods, raynaud’s, puffy face, etc). but have not had bloodwork done in a couple of years. The blood work from a couple of years ago was normal. Do all nodules appears suspicious for Hoshi’s on an U/S? Thank you!\n",
      "I was dx with hyper thyroid March 3rd. I went to the dr bc I felt exhausted, I've had hand tremors, increased heart rate, sweating, mood swing, hair loss, foggy memory, itchy skin, eye pain, high blood pressure (for me), insomnia, my whole body hurts, the list could go on and on. I chocked it all up to be exhausted bc I just had a baby 3 months ago. I thought I had postpartum anxiety. It's been about month and I can't get in to see the specialist for another week. I've researched treatment and I'm not even sure what to do. I'm so confused. I'm 23 my husband is 33 and we want to have more children. We would like to get pregnant again in about 9 months so my treatment options are very limited. And I am terrified of doing the iodine radiation and the complications that could possibly come along with having my thyroid removed. :/ I would like to know everyone's opinions, pros and cons of the different treatments, and how are you doing now? If you are still reading this thank you so much!\n",
      "Hi Everyone, I'm brand new here but have been reading thyroid forums all over the internet for some time. I have kind of an interesting 'Thyroid Journey' that I thought I'd share here - mainly because my treatment is the opposite of most cases I hear about. I was started on Cytomel (Liothyronine) to treat a clinically 'mild' case of Hypothyroid, vs starting on Levothyroxine. I am recently very symptomatic and diagnosed with Hashimotio's, so now cutting Cytomel and adding Levothroxine. The question I have is that the endocrinologist prescribing the change didn't talk about titrating me down on Cytomel and onto Levo, she just cut Cytomel from 25mcg (in the morning) to 17.5mcg (over the day) and added 50mcg of Levothroxine. I was nervous about this and felt really strange the first day, but am feeling kind of immediately better these second and third days. So, just curious if anyone out there has experience or opinions on this. In my experience, starting and increasing Cytomel has an efficacy lag time of up to 6 weeks; I was wondering if this is the experience people have had with Levo as well. So, just a note on symptoms: In my experience, Cytomel is very helpful, but it can become ineffective and when out of balance or a little too much, where it creates negative symptoms. I can not believe how cloudy my thinking got just increasing from 20 to 25 mcg. It was scaring me. My sleep also changed dramatically, from comfortably waking up around 10, to not being able to sleep past dawn. And in the beginning, I wasn't able to fall asleep till 4 or 5 am. So I had a few months of just feeling wired, exhausted, on edge and anxious, and having increasing difficulty concentrating and with memory issues. Yes - these are symptoms that come with Hashimoto's, but the Cytomel really exacerbated them when it was too high of a dose for me. At a lower dose I think it has been really beneficial for me. Anyway. Recently my primary (who now left the clinic ) ran an antibody test, which showed some slight negative activity. The endo I saw a month later confirmed Hashimoto's. I've spoken to her about my symptoms at this point and this is where we are at now: cutting Cytomel, adding Levo. I have heard that starting T3 (Cytomel) can 'dump' a built up excess of (damaging) Reverse T3 at the start of therapy. I have a hunch that this is why I felt so great for the first year. But my endo told me, longer term studies in my demographic show that symptoms reverse in the short term and tend to go back to where they were in the longer term with only T3 treatment. I feel this has been true to my experience and I'm actually excited / optimistic to see what kind of stabilizing force adding some T4 might have. I welcome any thoughts or questions about all this. I know a lot of people with thyroid conditions have Dr's who will only prescribe T4.\n",
      "Hi there everybody, Sorry to trouble you all but I am getting desperate and would really appreciate some advice. I have a lot of symptoms of hyperthryoidism, although they seem to come and go in what I can only describe as 'flare ups' or bad periods. My TSH and T4 are in the normal range, but last week an ultrasound showed I had an enlarged thyroid and two non suspicious looking thyroid nodules. My boyfriend said he and his family could see I have an enlarged thyroid, but he says it was more enlarged a month ago but seems to have reduced a bit now. I have had various problems for some years now. I have been monitored by the autoimmune diseases department at the hospital because I have thrombocytopenia (low platelets) and some indicator of an autoimmune disease (not sure which one), but I have no diagnosis as yet. I was told in February the autoimmune indicator had switched off and gone dormant, but then I caught the flu and in the following month seemed to get very bad. In the past I have had a lot of problems with anxiety, mood swings and irritability. I have autism spectrum disorder and the psychiatrist at the autism centre put this down to characteristics of the autism and put me on mood stabilisers, which I came off about 6 months ago, but I now suspect this may be due to thyroid issues, as I have had all of these symptoms for years now. My anxiety and mood swings stopped about 6 months ago, but has come back somewhat over the past 6 weeks, in the sense that most of the time I feel absolutely fine, and then occasionally have a 10 minute sudden hit where I feel very very anxious for no apparent reason. It feels very bad all of a sudden and then after maybe 10 minutes just disappears. Over the past 6 weeks I've also experienced: feeling hungry a lot of the time days where I have felt very very irritated, but not often weeks of intolerance to heat feeling like I'm suffocating sometimes A years or so ago, all my symptoms were much worse and I had chronic palpitations and had various tests and minor surgery done to check my heart, which was fine. The palpitations later improved. I've had dry eyes for years. My hair is a frizzy, brittle mess. The problem that is really bothering me though is that i just can't sleep properly lately. Either I can't fall asleep at night, or I wake up after 6 or 7 hours and this is really hitting me hard, I'm just exhausted. I've tried prescription sleeping pills and melatonin but the melatonin aggravated the anxiety and the sleeping pills left me even more exhausted the next day. Many of the symptoms got very bad in the month after I caught the flu but many of them seem to have improved a lot since then, but I still can't sleep. I'm determined to find out if I have a problem but because the thyroid blood tests are normal I've been told they won't test further. I'm willing to pay for the tests privately, I just don't know which tests to do! Can anybody tell me what antibody tests I should do? Thank you!\n",
      "Hi, I have symptoms of hypothyroidism and discovered last month that I have high tpo antobodies( although only at 27 in January) I’ve miscarried twice and am interested in trying nutritional And supplement avenues to help my body heal. I’m reading root cause by dr. Wentz and believe I have leaky gut as well. However I’m 37 and I don’t feel like I can spend a year helping everything nutritionally before I try again. My functional medicine doctor told me today that it will be incredibly hard to stop synthroid after I begin, and I haven’t yet convinced any of my western docs to let me try Armour. I had severe headaches for three days after trying synthroid (25mcg)and severe sleepiness as well as two bouts of fluttering heart feelings. I stopped taking it after 6 days. Does anyone have experience with Armour use in pregnancy effectively dealing with the tpo antibodies? Has anyone used synthroid to help with miscarriage prevention and then been able to go back to not needing synthroid after? Thanks\n",
      "I have had a lot of weight gain the last 2=3 years and especially the last year and a half!! 20-30 pounds?! without a change in diet. Puzzled!!! I am not menopausal yet but age 46 female. I had my thyroid checked in Jan at my last physical was TSH 2.93 which I know is \"borderline\" for the newer guidelines....going to see my endrocrinologist to see if this might be why I continue to gain weight? I am even seeing a dietician since Nov due to my weight gain-and have been following a low car high protein diet since Nov-I actually think I have gained weight!!! UGGGG. Just wondering if anyone has experiences similiar?\n",
      "I posted here maybe sometime in March but I cannot find it anywhere. I tried looking for posts under my user name and everything comes up \"no results found\" so I will post it again. I am having a terrible time trying to lose weight. I was at the Dr on Thursday the 5th and he said if my test results are out of whack it will not help me lose the weight. As for the tiredness he blamed it on the 3 meds I take, I do 2 xanax at night to help me sleep, I take 1 vicodin in the morning and 1 at night to help with RA and for that wicked headache I get every now and then I was put on a muscle relaxer, but I only do half a pill because they are strong and I might do a half every 2 weeks. The headaches have really slowed down since I've been taking that script. I suffered with severe headaches not migraines for many years and only last summer my Dr decided to try the muscle relaxer. As for the Vicodin I've been on that for 15 years so my body is well adjusted all I get is relief from some of the RA pain. OK, back to the weight gain and tiredness, someone here suggested I have additional testing on my thyroid, I printed out a few pages and took them to my appt. My Dr refused saying they were no more effective in treating thyroid disorder so he only did the usual. My results were within the guild lines. So since I haven't changed my eating habits in years why did I gain so much weight? I now am going to try the Alli diet pill a try that since my daughter is also on the same mg for her under active thyroid and she lost 20 lbs using it. Here are the results of the test that was done. TSH with Free T4 if indicated Component Your Value Standard Range Flag TSH 1.97 uIU/mL 0.27 - 4.2 uIU/mL FREE T4 REFLEXIVE NOT APPLICABLE ng/dL 0.9 - 1.7 ng/dL So that's how my appointment went.

      "Hello All, I have been dealing with thyroid issues for years, but haven't ever been on a message board. However, I finally got a doctor here in Australia to listen and put me back on T3 in conjunction with my T4 therapy. I've felt like I was losing my mind and started doing some research, which led me to this forum. Background: Started experiencing hypo symptoms after the birth of my DS in 2005. Major weight gain, even though I was very active (was a mid distance dog musher, plus a mum and a high school teacher) and I ate relatively healthy. The doctors of course ran a myriad of tests and kept insisting it wasn't hypo thyroid, because my tests always came back in the \"normal\" ranges. Fast forward to 2011 when I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, had a TT which showed Hashimoto's, followed by I-131 treatment. Was put on T4 only, and kept suffering. Did the med bounce for 2 years until in 2013 I finally had a doctor try me on a combo of T3/T4 treatment. It was amazing! By 2015 I had lost most of the weight and hadn't felt healthier in my life. Then, I moved to Australia where I was told that they did not have T3. Did the med bounce again and all of my hypo symptoms came flooding back, including the weight. Just last week, I was finally able to see an Endo who listened to my symptoms and not my blood work. And guess what? Prescribed T3. I know my T4 dose was way too high (was on 175mcg). So, now I've been dropped to 125mcg of T4 and back on 5mcg of T3 twice a day. How long until I start feeling better again? I've already noticed a slight increase in energy (I don't feel like falling asleep all the time now). I've only just started the T3 a few days ago. This was my original dosage that worked for me before moving to Australia. Wondering if anyone has had changes, or did your dosages stay the same? Sorry for the long post. Am so happy to find others who understand what it's like to deal with all of these issues.\n",

      "Hello Everyone, I've been thinking about joining some forums for a while to get some feedback from people. I have a rather interesting scenario, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate/have any insights. Here's my story in a nutshell: When i was nineteen I had low thyroid hormones, about 0.03. a week after my initial test was taken, an endocrinologist tested me again and I was in normal ranges, but I still had symptoms of fatigue, hunger, thirst, increased heart rate, weak muscles. Long story short, through various alternative health means (supplements, homeopathy, exercise) I got to much more livable state of life Fast forward to now, at 25 years old. I had another major increase in symptoms about 3 years ago after drinking three weekends in a row. I went back in and my test showed me positive for Graves and Hashimoto's, and my thyroid levels were again 0.03. I was again referred to an endocrinologist, but in between my initial appointment/blood test and my endocrinologist appointment/blood test, I came upon a treatment of using canola oil on my neck where my thyroid is located. This really helped me feel a lot better, and my second test again showed my thyroid levels as normal. Over time I learned that certain foods made my symptoms worse, and long story short again, this has digressed to where if I eat certain things, I almost instantly feel pain in my thyroid and have symptoms. Right now, If I were to eat a piece of cake, my tongue would swell and hurt, and thryoid would ache for a few days, I would be so hungry 4 meals a day would hardly suffice, Tired, etc. not fun Symptoms I currently experience: Pain in thyroid, weakness of limbs (forearms and lower legs), itchy/painful inner ears, moderate insomnia, anxiety, pain in my lower row of teeth shortness of breath, slight tightness in chest, shooting nerve pain in arms and legs occasionally, swollen painful tongue Foods that trigger these symptoms: all bread, all alcohol (especially beer) sugary sweets (not fruit, except bananas), walnuts, almonds, some low quality hot dogs, pop, breading All of these foods affect me more and for a longer time period the more of them I consume. Also, when I apply castor or olive oil to my neck multiple times, it causes my thyroid to hurt for a while, and then all my symptoms improve drastically by the next morning, and after a few more applications, almost entirely gone. I have restricted myself to a diet of meat, veggies, fruit, and...potatoes, that's about it. I am currently scheduled for allergy testing in a month. Anybody else experience physical pain in their thyroid and major food sensitives?\n",

      "Hi I'm new to this forum, found it while trying to find information about hypothyroidism. From what I'm reading it's very obvious my TSH is very high but just how low is my FT4? TSH: 73.309 Ref Range: 0.350-4.940 FREE T4: 0.40 0.70-1.48 My doctor sent off for more tests which will take a bit more time to come back. She is starting me on 50mg of levothyroxine starting today. It is strange as I had TSH level checked in November and it was 0.91. I should also mention I am 6 months postpartum which is why I chalked up most of the symptoms to having a new baby....\n",
      "A week ago I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with a TSH of 128. This seems really high. My T4 Free was 0.33 and my thyroid peroxidase antibody was 3,013 (also seems really high).

If so, did your gallbladder function return to normal at some point? Thanks!! Patti\n",
      "So I had begun experiencing a range of symptoms slowly over a period of time, very heavy periods, weird brain fog accompanied by a strange puffy head feeling and very poor memory (so bad my OH has to tell me things we've done years ago). Then suddenly last Oct I just put on a stone in weight, I have always been quite slim - i normally carry weight on my bum and hips, but some of it is on my tummy and the top of my hips. I developed acne, perioral dermatitis, tremendous fatigue and worsening of my already bad memory. I was also getting these weird foggy headaches (no pain, just pressure) more frequently and they left me with a bad case of the stupids for days after. I went to my doctor who has said that I have nothing to worry about, just a slightly low T3, she didn't even make any suggestions as to what may be the cause. Should I really just let this go? My symptoms are no better. The results are...

I take no HR treatment. the pain during that time resolved after few months. I do experience some necks and calf pain occasionally which resolves itself. only changes I can see are ive added more Levo and decreased D. thyroid. Used to take Levo at PM and D. thyroid in AM. As of Feb have been taking them together in the AM. Im confused with my recent physical symptoms again any insight into my situation would be so very welcomed and appreciated. Thanks\n",
      "I have been happily taking Amour for years with great results. After being diagnosed with Hashimoto’s, I worked for a year or two on dosages of synthetic meds and then started on Amour and bingo. I felt normal again. My story began with a sore neck which led to a doc saying I had a goiter and eventually being diagnosed by an Endo. I was also feeling like crap then. SO, I now have a sore neck again.I am also getting some of the same symptoms. I called my Endo to see if he could advise me by phone but found out he has moved. I will need to see my primary to get a referral to a new Endo. I am trying to avoid the miserable time I had going hyper before going on meds. I still take daily meds! I am also in a new state for the winter/spring which also confuses things. I would guess that I have been in great health for over 5 years. When this originally happened I was told ( in layman’s terms) the pain was caused by a nodule that had broken open and released to much thyroid in my system. Does anyone have any advice for me? I don’t know who to call now and I really want to avoid the misery I went through before.\n",
      "Hi all, I've been having a low grade FUO (fever of unknown origin) for about 9 weeks now, along with major fatigue and brain fog (I've been off of work the entire time). It started with a flu/upper respiratory infection that was VERY bad. I was given antibiotics which cleared up my sinus pressure/congestion, but the fever and fatigue remain... This lead to a chest/abdominal/pelvis CT scan. We didn't find anything, but a single thyroid nodule. My doctor says this isn't the cause of my symptoms, but now we have to follow up with this too. I had an ultrasound today, showing one nodule at .97cm x .8cm x .7cm. The tech commented to me that they'll probably want to biopsy it because of the large size and because there is only one nodule. I haven't heard from my doctor about it yet. I'm really scared of the biopsy. It terrifies me. I'm also frustrated because I feel like this is just a rabbit hole we're going down, meanwhile my other problematic symptoms (fever) are being ignored. My TSH and free T4 are normal, btw. The only abnormal blood work I've had in this enormous, extensive workup is a slightly elevated CRP (.4 with a normal range of 0 - .29). Tested negative twice for Lyme, mono, CMV, etc. Infectious disease consultation was fruitless. I'm supposed to see a rheumatologist for the fever, but they can't see me until March 30th. Any experiences with biopsies? I'm afraid they'll want me to do this. Can't we just monitor it for growth? I'm scared this will turn into a thyroid removal surgery, and that my fever will still remain...\n",

      "Hello everyone! I'm posting in hopes someone can give me some advice. I'm 32 years old and female if that helps any. I was given a blood test a year ago that flagged my calcium as high (10.8 and I also had one from 6 years back flagged at 10.4), but my doctor said it was fine. More recently I had a different doctor look over some of my medical info for something unrelated. He told me I needed a second opinion on my calcium. My second opinion came from a family doctor who seemed to know a surprising amount about hyperparathyroidism. He had them draw my blood (which the hospital lost and had to redo). The results just came back today with my PTH being 117, calcium 10.1 and vit d 5.5 The nurse wanted to call me in a vit d prescription but the doctor told her no and to wait until I see an endocrinologist. I'm incredibly stressed right now about the whole thing and all the endocrinologists around here have 3 month long waiting lists. Does this sound like hyperparathyroidism? What should I expect from the endocrinologist and what are some things I need to be asking them? How do I know I need to find a new endocrinologist? Are the sestimibi and ultrasound tests really as inaccurate as I am reading and if so what am I supposed to do instead? Thank you so much to anyone that replies!\n",

Scalp burns only at the point where I’ve lost the most hair. They won’t treat me with any meds because thyroid is showing that it’s still functioning. I have the symptoms of a problem thyroid ...from nails changing and fatigue to feeling some depression now and some weight gain.

      "Hi! So I’ve never posted on any kind of boards or forums before and although I’ve tried to do my own research, I’m still stuck with questions. Hopefully someone will be able to help me understand myself a bit. I’m 19 years old and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism when I was 16. My resting heart rate was averaging between 120-130 and I had lost a significant amount of weight. Free T4 was 7.8, free t3 was 10.2. I was seeing a pediatric endocrinologist who wobbled around “could be this, could be that” and within a few months of 10 mg methimazole and 25mg atenolol, I went into remission. 6 months later, my blood work showed that i was hyper again. I still went to doctors but refused to take the methimazole due to the weight gain I experienced the first time (70 pounds within 6 months). When I turned 18, i switched every doctor i had to non-pediatric. I eventually got in with an endocrine specialist who sat me down and said “this is Graves’ disease, I am surprised you walk around without any debilitating issues and still feel alright. At any given moment if you put any extra stress on your body, your heart could fail you. I will not be your doctor if you leave my office without being put on meds and I honestly suggest you do the surgery” so with a little bit of time to think, we scheduled my total thyroidectomy to happen a month later, November 20, 2017. The first two weeks following my total thyroidectomy were two of the best weeks in a really long time. I felt good, I had energy, I was happy. My family and friends said that I did a 180 turn-around and couldn’t believe how much better of a person I was. I went for my two week post-op with the surgeon. Following my surgery, the surgeon prescribed me .112MG levothyroxine. The endocrine specialist gave me .125MG synthroid. The nurse at the hospital said to do what the surgeon gave me, so I had. But at my 2 week post op, the surgeon told me to start taking the .125MG synthroid and then wrote in his report to my specialist “continue use of .125MG synthroid” and made no notes of me ever using .112MG levothyroxine. I have been beyond irritable, can’t calm myself down when I’m angry, I’ve had bouts of insomnia, my energy levels are so low, and I’ve had my period for 15 days (super heavy which I’m not used to, I’m used to 3 days of a medium-light flow almost every 3 months). I’ve lashed out on family and friends and been a cranky mean person all around. This isn’t like me and it’s driving me crazy seeing the damage it’s doing after feeling so great the first two weeks after surgery. Can anyone please help me to understand why I am feeling the way I’m feeling and what I should be doing to make this change easier? I just want to be myself again\n",
      "Hi, I have started my hypothyroid treatment journey with the help of this board three years ago. I was diagnosed as Hashi's due to elevated thyroglubin antibody and TSH 4.57. They did not test for FT3 at that time but my FT4 was 0.87 (ref. range 0.58-1.64). I had high thyroglubin antibodies for the first year, later my doctor stop ordering them. She first gave me synthetic thyroid hormone, but because I did not well with it, we changed to Armor which worked great. I move to abroad, before moving I stocked a year's worth of Armor (I cannot find it in here) and started to work with another doctor. He ordered tests twice. (The second one is a month after the first one and more extensive and conducted another lab.) My new test results showed that Test on 12/ 27 TSH 2.79 [0.30-4.00] FT3 3.90 [3.10-6.80] FT4 12.50 [12-22.00] Thyroglubin antibodies low. (suggesting No Hashi's) My doctor has increased the dosage of my medication and asked for another test. The result came back with low thyroglubin antibodies. Slightly decreased TSH (1.75 ) but also decreased FT3 and FT4 (lower than the reference range). My ferritin levels and VitD are also low. When I lived in the States, I felt myself better when my TSH was around or slightly lower than 1 and my previous doctor agreed with me. However my new doctor does not want to increase the dosage and seems a little bit concerned about the absence of antibodies (he thinks that I might not have Hashi's in the first place) and decreased FT3 and FT4 with decreased TSH. He wants me to stay on this dosage and see him again in July. However I do not feel all right (fatigued, difficulty in concentrating, gaining weight) and now I am very confused. So one more time I am asking your opinions. Why the levels of FT3 and FT4 decreased when my TSH seems to go in the right direction? I'd greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks, G. Type 2\n",

      "Hello. A few months ago I had blood tests because I was not feeling that good and my doctor told me to also test my thyroid. The results showed that my TSH was 4.3(higher than normal) and I also had low cholesterol levels( I didn't get tested for T3 and T4). After that, I did an ultrasound but my thyroid gland didn't seem swollen/looked normal. Then the doctors told me not to worry about it and that I am fine and that I should just check it again after a few months to be sure if it bothered me that much. I feel like I have a lot of Hypothyroidism's symptoms (most of them, except weight gain;it's still easy for me to lose weight). So I was wondering can I have Hypothyroidism but not gain any weight, have low cholesterol levels (apparently Hypothyroidism raises them) and have my thyroid gland looking normal? If not, then what could cause my TSH being 4,3? I will go to a doctor soon I just wanted to hear your opinion. Thanks in advance.\n",

      "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto disease a year ago. Previous to being diagnosed I became really ill with severe fatigue. I found out that I had low iron and so wasn't absorbing my thyroxine. The doctor gave me 210mg of ferrous fumerate to take daily and I started to feel better and have more energy. After I finished the iron and stopped taking it, I became tired again, so the doctor gave me some more. I have had my blood test taken again since then and although it is always within the correct levels, it is always on the low side and this is when taking the iron. I have been taking this amount for over a year, but yesterday I read that too much iron can lead to iron toxicity and give you the same symptoms as if you weren't taking any iron. The packet also said do not take longer than 6 months. I now have a lower dose packet ( 105 mg) of iron and have been taking this since January but am starting to feel tired again. I am now anxious about taking more, but worried that I might start to feel really tired again and won't be able to function properly.

      "I've been taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism for 20 years. I was stable on a dose of 112 mcg and felt great. Two years ago I finally got my free t3 and free t4 tested and my free t3 was a bit low. Under dr supervision, I lowered my levothyroxine dose to 100 mcg and added 2.5 mcg cytomel once a day. This worked for 2 years. Most recent tests (September), still felt great but my tsh dropped from .1 to .01, free t3 and free t4 at top of range. Dr told me to stop the cytomel and skip one levothyroxine a week. After 2 weeks, I had an elevated heart rate of 139 at rest for 24 hours at which point I went to the ER. They said dehydration and possible migraine and gave me fluids and pain relief. Suggested that it was overmedication of thyroid meds. Cardiologist said the same thing, still waiting for primary care appt. I took 1/2 dose (50mcg) for 1 week and am now alternating 100mcg and 50mcg until I see my Dr. It took a week of 1/2 dose to get my heart rate back to normal at moderate activity level. Finally working out again after 2 weeks off. Feeling a little hypo now, but scared to increase my dose. How long does it take to stabilize on a lower dose and is it likely I'll ever get back to my original dose? Hyper was scary, but hypo isn't great either 🤔\n",
      "Any advice or information would be much appreciated. Thank you. Three years ago, I got a super swollen neck out of no where, I got really thirsty and started peeing a lot. That was my main symptom at the time. I waited a few weeks for it to go away, but it never did. So I started seeing some doctors, they thought I had diabetes, nope, checked my thyroid hormone levels which were normal, checked for diabetes insipidus, normal. Basically I got a battery of tests all which came back 100% normal. I went to 8 doctors total assuming they'd tell me what's wrong, but they said every test they do is 100% normal and that there isn't anything they could do. I don't have the average symptoms of a hypo or hyper thyroid. I haven't gained or lost much weight, or overall felt that much different. So I gave up with doctors. THey told me they couldn't help so I lived with it. I was constantly thirsty, and had a swollen neck. I've finally decided I'm going to try to figure out what's wrong with me. Over the 3 years, I've realized that I think salt makes my throat swell and causes the symptoms. If I ever eat too much salt in the day, I swell up and don't feel well. I get a swollen neck, a headache, cloudy mind and still get an unquenchable thirst. Working out/sweating seems to help a bit. Does anyone have any similar experiences with their thyroid or parathyroid causing thirst, swollen neck when eating salty foods? Thanks for any help.\n",
      "Was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in Oct. 2014. I was started on Levothyroxin & Liothyronine (Cytomel).

I know that many people who were on Synthroid (Levothyroxine) alone & are placed on Armour have improvement. Is there anyone out there that has been on synthetic T4 & T3 and still shown improvement when switched to the natural version?\n",
      "As near as I can tell my T4 is normal but the TSH at 11.73 is high, is that correct? Doctor has not called yet so maybe they are not concerned. They switched my from Levothroyxine to the real Synthroid .50 mgs. Thanks\n",
      "Hi, i am around 40 year old. i have been hypothyroid since past 12 + years. on Synth/Levothyroxin - 120mcg and changed to 100mcp in past 6 years. Last year...i started to avoid gluten some..as i heard its related somewhat and wasnt good anyway.. after 6 mos of doing that..i did the TSH with antibody test..and antibody came out very high...so doc said to come back after 3 mos..no changes to medication since last 3 months..i have pain in bottom of feet(liek plantar fasciitis) and hands..feeling very lethargic and body pain....headaches...i feel my face is swollen...my jaws definitely feel bulkier... always had a very sensitive stomach for a long time... so did the antibody again..came out high and suddenly the hypo became hyper now..doc recommended to meet with endocrinologist...did ultrasound..and thyroid is inflamed.. she recommended one week of prednisole.....i am concerned to have steroids..but since its only for a week..should i just have it...? i just want my energy back..most of the times..i feel like i will just break down crying..are these hormones as well a fact of the thyroid issue?\n",
      "I have a strong family history of thyroid failure, and have regularly had mine tested. This year, TSH levels were over 10 in two independent tests, with normal t4. I also had brain fog, swelling, constipation, hoarseness and fatigue. No weight gain, which is unfortunate, because I always was and still am underweight. Started on 25 ug levothyroxine and felt better in less than a week. Everything improved except constipation, which is seriously bothering me, and has not improved with fiber, liquid, walking, etc. I do not have any unwanted side effects such as palpitations, sweating or weight loss. Just got my new labs tests 8 weeks into treatment, and TSH is 3.15, which is normal range (up to 4.7). Free T4 is 1.33, a little higher than before, and still within normal. I have been reading that the ideal TSH range in treatment could be lower than the normal range (lower than 2), and would like to know if any of you has any further details on this point so I can discuss with the Endo during my consultation. Could an increase in dose help me with the constipation and should I bring this up?\n",
      "New to thyroid treatment: Question about armor 15 mg… I just started yesterday taking this and I had a terrible night ... palpitations and just overall didn’t feel well did anyone have this experience with Armour? Just starting to take this medication, Is it something I just need to get used to? I was afraid to take it this morning but I did go ahead and take it. I contacted my doctors office but they haven’t got back to me yet. I’m just hoping I can take it if it will help me feel better. So far I feel worse LOL any feedback would be so appreciated!\n",
      "Hi everyone this is my first post and hopefully my first steps turns real wellness So I was diagnosed with Hashimotos and Graves disease last year after a trip the ER. I was sent to an Endo and put on Methimazole ever since, my labs are tested for TSH and Free t4 and they bounce back and forth like a yoyo I see her monthly and one month theyre good the next month theyre bad. No instruction on how to assist levels other than to take my medicine. Up down on the dosage regardless of what symptoms I tell her I have. Right now im 20mgs of methimazole last month I was on 10mgs. I am also on propanothol 20mgs. Lately though I feel much more hypo than hyper. I have had extreme hair loss im not even sure how I have hair left on my head. I have also gained 40 pounds in the last six months without any changes to my diet. I dont eat great but gaining that much weight again is insane. Ive had crushing fatigue lately. Anxiety, Insomnia and mood swings, Insanely dry itchy skin to the point it almost feels like hives, Joint pain and general brain fog. I also have intense sugar and salt cravings. 8/15: Test Low Normal High Reference Range Units T4,Free(Direct) 0.90 0.82-1.77 ng/dL Tsh 1.900 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL 9/28: T4,Free(Direct) 1.14 0.82-1.77 ng/dL Tsh 2.900 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL 11/16: T4,Free(Direct) 2.15 0.82-1.77 ng/dL Tsh 0.047 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL These are the last three months of labs that my endo requested she only test for my TSH and Free T4 even though I have asked repeatedly for t3, I can put more on here if needed. I finally got the money together to order a test for my t3 and reverse t3 12/1: T3 Reverse, LC : 35 , Range 8-25 (ng/dL) T3 Free: 3.1, Range 2.3-4.2, Range 2.3-4.2 (pg/mL) T4 Free: 1.8, Range 0.8-1.8 (ng/dL) I also got my iron levels tested again since I have a history of anemia but none of the few drs I go to ever seem to want to check on it. % Saturation: 11 Range:11-50 Ferritin 118 Range 10-154 (ng/mL) Iron Binding 378 Range 250-450 (mcg/dL) Iron Total 41 Range 40-190 (mcg/dL) I plan to get my cortisol levels tested later when I have money. Though that probably wont be to til after the first of the year. I would love to go naturepath but they arent allowed to practice in our state and its too far and expensive for me to travel. I can't get any of these bullheaded drs to listen to me even when I ask specifically for the labs I want and give reason for it. Its the well I am the dr speech.... Im looking for any assistance that can be offered. I am sick of being sick. I am incredible frustrated. I dont feel currently I am getting anywhere and really feel worse. I feel my Endo and GP are just screwing around and soon im going to be bald and excessively overweight. I am tired of missing work I am afraid I am going to be fired soon. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!\n",

      "Hello all, I have a bit of a problem and need a sanity check. In early 2000’s I was diagnosed with Graves disease. I had all the normal symptoms except the bulging eyes, but had one other symptom that was considered to be rare. When my sugar levels went high my potassium levels would drop like a stone and cause temporary paralysis. For several years now I have been seeing an ENDO and my meds have been stable, I take Armour 120mg 4 times a week and 150 3 times a week. And have done so for probably the last 3 or 4 years. This summer my original ENDO changed to private practice, the replacement ENDO on my first visit immediately wants to take me off the Armour and put me on LEVO and Cytomel. Why would any DR do that? Below are the history of my labs: T4 Free 2012/1.02 Took Armor medicine after test 2012/1.02 2012/0.86 2013/0.86 2014/0.59 2014/0.8 2014/1.1 2016/1.1 Took Armour medicine 2 hours before test 2017/1.1 Took Armour medicine 2 hours before test T3, Total 2012/1.40 Took Armor medicine after test 2016/2.49 Took Armour medicine 2 hours before test 2017/2.62 Took Armour medicine 2 hours before test 2017/1.30 Took Armor medicine after test TSH 2014/0.21 2014/0.07 2015/0.10 2017/0.14 2017/0.59 2017/0.32 eAG (mg/dL) 2012/114.0 2013/119.8 2014/114.0 2014/122.6 2017/114.0 2017/114.0 Hemoglobin A1C 2012/5.6 2013/5.8 2014/5.6 2014/5.9 2017/5.6 2017/5.6 Cholesterol, Total 2012/177 2012/194 2013/142 2014/127 2014/125 2016/136 2017/120 HDL Cholesterol 2012/36 2013/32 2014/33 2014/34 2016/42 2017/36 LDL Calculated 2012/114 2013/85 2014/66 2017/65 Triglycerides 2012/136 2013/119 2014/141 2014/109 2016/91 2017/97 VLDL CHOLESTEROL CALCULATED 2012/27 2013/24 2014/28 2017/19 Vit D, 25-Hydroxy 2012/21 2013/32 2014/23 2014/29 2016/24.6 2017/33.3\n",
      "I'm at the end of my rope here. All my labs are \"normal\". TSH hovers between 0.5-0.6 when I feel the symptoms. I had one reading in the last few years of 0.7 when I was feeling decent. T3 and T4 are in the middle of the range. The problem is, I have all the symptoms. I've had a feeling like a lump in my throat for the last 6 months, sweaty hands and feet (but they are always cold), brain fog, difficulty concentrating, jittery, anxious, itchy and the list goes on. In addition I have probably had this a long time. I had hypertension in all 3 of my pregnancies and I had to have a hip replaced from arthritis at the age of 37. Am I way off here? The doctors think I'm crazy, quite literally. My primary wanted to send me to psychiatry to be evaluated for ADD! I keep trying to impress upon them how crappy I feel. Mood swings, crying spells etc are making me feel crazy. I finally got my doctor to order an u/s which is this week. When they find my thyroid is enlarged what is the next step? I'm just ready for some relief. Will they do any treatment after they get those results or will I have to have more testing? The only labs they did at the doctor's office this last time was the TSH. The T3 and T4 were done in Sept. How do you cope? How do you advocate for yourself? When I called the doctors office to ask for help with symptoms the response was a psych eval. I'm not crazy, this is not 6 separate issues, just do your job! How is it ethical to just leave me out here miserable for months? I really just don't know what to do now. Can anyone help? What testing do I need to ask for next? Michelle\n",
      "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in 2004. The endocrinologist forgot to treat me until 2011 since they were all concerned about my diabetes first. Just this summer, I went through two tests, 3 months apart for T4 and T3. On the first I had low/normal T4 and 0 T3. Three months later, after cutting my levothyroxine the tests came up lower/normal on T4 and 0 on T3. I have been to 2 endocrinologist's but neither doctor sees this as important, and just say my T3 is low. I feel that my pituitary is not functioning but they say I don't know what I'm talking about. They want to cut my levothyroxine even more. I have hypothyroid symptoms, have gained 40 lbs since they cut my levothyroxine for the second time in May and August, and can barely function. What do you think?\n",
      "Hi everyone! I am 25, a female. I am very very confused about what doctors say, what I read, my test results and how I have been feeling... I have been experiencing hypothyroidism symptoms for around 1-2 years, and they are getting worse as the time passes. I have been getting low-normal thyroid hormone results, but my tsh is always normal. Endo's don't prescribe me anything as low normal is normal for them even if I have symptoms. Meanwhile one of the doc's realised that I have insulin resistance (even though I exercise very well regularly) related hypoglycaemia and prescribed me metformin. I have been taking it for last 3 months. It doesn't help for anything, including weight control. The last 4 months, for the first time in my life, I have experienced irregular and missed periods. I dont have PCOS or other gyneacological problems according to my gyneacologist. But he still wanted to see my hormones. Obviously my thyroid hormones, especially T3 are lower than 2 months ago. I insisted every endo on searching my pituitary functions and possible reasons why my thyroid levels are low, I tell them what I have read on articles - but somehow doctors react agressive to such approach from the patient. I still believe the complaints I have are because of my low thyroid hormones. It may be euthyroid, less likely secondary hypothyroid, or low T3 syndrome which is not a purely thyroid disfunction problem. I have been reading a lot, believing taking my FT3,FT4,T3 and T4 to above from the mid range (to an optimal level) may help me. But I am so scared of self-medicating as all the endocs (4 famous endos in my country) were very very sure about I don't need a thyroid medication. Could you please tell me what do you think about my results? FT3 3.60 (range 3.10-6.80) FT4 13.90 (range 12.00-22.00) T3 0.75 (range 0.80-2.00) T4 6.02 (range 5.10-14.10 TSH 1.30 (range 0.30-4.00) As I said I have low thyroid function symptoms, and what I know is these hormones are optimal when they are above their midranges. I also read that if RT3 is higher than 15 (in another source it says 12) it is not a good sign. My result from around 2-3 months ago is RT3 18 (range 10-24) Please help me! I am very desperate and tired of searching this, reading articles and visiting doctors. What should I do now?\n",
      "On Monday I decided to call m doctor and ask for a FT3, FT4 and a TPO to be done. They agreed and I got those results today. The FT3 and FT4 are squarely in the normal range, which is kind of discouraging. However the TPO was 78! The reference range for that is 0-35, meaning mine is more than double the upper limit. I feel vindicated in one way, yet like I still may be in for fight. I also had an ultrasound last night which was \"normal\". I haven't seen that report yet. The good news is this along with my reports of my symptoms seem to be enough to warrant a referral to endocrinology. I'm afraid actually being seen could take a while. I think there is a shortage of endocrinologists all over the country. Or is that a local thing? Anyone have thoughts as to why I would be symptomatic and yet the only evidence supporting my claims is the TPO? Is that common?\n",
      "Hey everyone. I could really use some insight. I was finally (finally! Yay!) put on medicine about 8-9 weeks ago after trying to find a doctor to take me seriously for over a year. I had all the classic hypo symptoms and it was ruining my life. After only a few days of being on the pill (50mcg Levothyroxine), I noticed an improvement. In just two weeks or so, I was able to go up and down stairs and not get winded. Energy came back. Hair stopped falling out. I could exercise again, and could bike for 30 minutes-an hour with relative ease. I felt good again. Then, after about 6-7 weeks on the pill, it all stopped. I started gradually feeling terrible again. Now my sleep is all kinds of out of whack again. It's crazy, and I'm losing all of the energy I just gained back all over again. My doctor upped me to 100mcg, he's a fertility specialist and not an expert in thyroid, but he heard my story and was sympathetic, especially since I was unable to get pregnant and afraid to get pregnant while having these symptoms. He said if I need to go up much more, he won't be able to help me, and I'm going to have to start this process all over again. What I don't understand is that my levels were baaaaarely off. At it's worst, my TSH was 3.2 or something around there. My T4 was very slightly low, and T3 might have been very slightly not ideal. No antibodies apparently. It was a miracle anyone put me on medicine. But if I'm just subclinical, why did my body plateau on 50mcg? I'm scared I'll plateau again on 100mcg. How could I need so much medicine when I'm just barely out of whack? Does it mean it's something else?\n",
      "It just keeps getting worse and i do not know what to do.. My body cannot handle Synthroid at all.. After 3 days on 50MCG I felt like i was on coke, severe insonmia, irritability, jitters etc.. So I stop call the Dr tell him and he says stop wait 3 weeks have a blood test.. So yesterday I did just that & after 4 hours go by he calls and tells me he wants to up my dose to 75MCG.. I promptly told the Nurse the DR and I will discuss at the next visit.. But nope he still sent it over to the pharmacy.. Thankfully I managed to get the point across to the pharmacy that under no circumstances are they to fill a synthroid rx EVER for me.. I just cannot grasp why my DR who knows my body rejects this medication, still seems to want to push it. Is it time to demand a second opinion or a visit to a specialist? or is it time to fire my dr entirely.. also have any of you had a severe reaction to synthroid like I have? Words cannot describe how immensely horrible this medication makes me feel.. p.s I honestly do not feel any symptoms that one with one with hypothyroidism should without meds and NEVER have.. i do not get why he continues to push this issue. #frustrated\n",
      "I had blood work done and my ALT and AST levels are mildly elevated. Everything else is normal including GGT but the doctor is immediately blaming alcohol. I'm curious if it could be from my thryroid (or lack of). I had thyroid cancer and had it removed and my T4 free level was normal, TSH was low and T3 Free was low and my Creatine Kinase was high. Any thoughts? I'm scared because I have to have a liver ultrasound on Monday.\n",
