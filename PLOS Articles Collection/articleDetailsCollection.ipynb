      "Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) result from excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the lung, causing irreversible damage to the lung architecture. Clinical management of ILDs differs depending on the diagnosis, but differentiation between subtypes can be difficult and better clinical biomarkers are needed. In this study, we use a 166-gene NanoString assay to investigate whether there are ILD subtype-specific transcripts in whole blood. We identified one transcript, killer cell lectin like receptor 1 (KLRF1), as differentially expressed between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD), and identified two transcripts (VCAN, LTK) associated with IPF expression against other ILD subtypes. These findings were validated by examining their expression in ILD lung, with KLRF1 expression significantly higher in SSc-ILD compared to IPF and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) samples. Taken together, this pilot study provides support for the use of the peripheral transcriptome in identifying diagnostic biomarkers of ILD with biological relevance.\n",

      "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are crucial for protecting human skin from infection. Therefore, the expression levels of beneficial AMPs such as ribonuclease 7 (RNase 7) must be appropriately regulated in healthy human skin. However, there is limited understanding regarding the regulating AMP expression, especially when using applications directly to healthy human skin. Here, we investigated the effects of the extract of Ruscus aculeatus (RAE), a medicinal plant native to Mediterranean Europe and Africa that is known to have a high safety level, on AMP expression in primary human keratinocytes. Treatment with RAE induced RNase 7 expression, which was suppressed by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. The autophagic flux assay and the immunofluorescence analysis of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-Ⅱ and p62 showed that RAE inhibited late-phase autophagy. Moreover, both the inhibition of early-phase autophagy by EX-527, an inhibitor of silent information regulator of transcription 1 (SIRT1) and its enhancement by resveratrol, an activator of SIRT1 inhibited RNase 7 and ERK expression, indicating that autophagosome accumulation is necessary for RAE-induced RNase 7 expression. Additionally, spilacleoside was identified as the active component in RAE. These findings suggest that RAE promotes RNase 7 expression via ERK activation following inhibition of late-phase autophagy in primary human keratinocytes and that this mechanism is a novel method of regulation of AMP expression.\n",

      "Climate warming can precipitate mismatches in plant-pollinator interactions by altering their phenologies of both parties, impacting ecosystem services. While most studies have focused on long-term, seasonal phenological shifts, the effect of warming on short-term phenological match-mismatch in these interactions remains unclear. Here, we investigate how experimental warming affects within-day foraging behavior of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and plant anthesis, and whether the resulting changes in bee pollen composition, in terms of the relative abundance of pollen from different plant species, influences larval development. Experimental warming advanced both the within-day foraging by bees and anthesis of Bidens pilosa—the predominant pollen source among all plant species represented in the collected pollen. Through experimental manipulation of pollen composition, we demonstrated that an increased proportion of B. pilosa pollen in the diet enhanced bee larval growth efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates that warming may influence pollinator interactions with the many plant species by affecting pollinator behaviors and plant anthesis on short-term temporal scales, with potential implications for pollinator larval development.\n",

International databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Science Direct, African Journal Online, Directory of Open Access Journal, and African Index Medicus) and Ethiopian university repositories (Jimma, Addis Ababa, Haramaya, Hawassa, and Gondar Universities) were searched from September 4–15, 2023, to identify articles published on the topic. The pooled prevalence of hyperemesis gravidarum with a 95% confidence interval was presented using the forest plots. The heterogeneity of the studies was checked by I2 with its corresponding p-values and the Galbraith plot. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity.

      "Cervical cancer has been identified as the fourth most common form of malignancy affecting and killing women globally. Nurses caring for cervical cancer patients are exposed to emotional and psychological distress due to late presentation and the burden of care. Resilience has been identified as one of the effective ways of helping nurses to cope well with the stress of oncology nursing, but this remains undetermined in Ghana\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aim\n",
      "This study explored personal and workplace factors influencing the resilience of nurses caring for women diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer (stage III and IV) in a resource-constrained setting in Ghana\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method\n",
      "Using a qualitative approach, we recruited twenty nurses and midwives who had worked for a year and above caring for advanced-stage cervical cancer patients at the national referral hospital in Ghana. We conducted in-depth interviews between July, 2022 to September, 2022 which were audio-taped with participants’ consent. Transcription was done verbatim, and analysis conducted using thematic analysis approach with the aid of NVivo 10.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The results revealed experience as a safety toolkit, inherent desire to help/care for the patient, emotional numbness and maintaining professional outlook as personal factors influencing resilience among the participants. Regarding the workplace factors influencing resilience, we identified the main theme of demands of caregiving for advanced cervical cancer patients with the following sub-themes; severity of cases managed, nature of care rendered, activities of care given, reshuffling, schedules and gender mirroring as an exacerbator of psychological suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Resilience among nurses and midwives caring for terminally ill cervical cancer patients is influenced by longer years of service, intrinsic motivation to work as a nurse, and the defense strategy of emotional numbness and professionalism at the individual level. Also, the huge demand of caregiving serves as a major workplace factor affecting the resilience of nurses and midwives. We recommend strategies such as regular ward conferences and in-service trainings aimed at enhancing job-experience, inherent desire to render care and professionalism be adopted in resource-constrained settings to improve nurses’ resilience. In addition, political actors and management of hospitals must prioritize allocation of resources for advanced cervical cancer care with particular focus on providing more specialized nurses and midwives.\n",

      "To eliminate vertical transmission of HIV, global institutions recommend using a risk-guided approach for HIV prevention services in antenatal and postnatal settings.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis to identify common predictors of maternal HIV acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We searched four databases for full-text articles that estimated associations between at least one predictor and risk of HIV acquisition among pregnant and/or lactating women (PLW) in SSA. We restricted our synthesis to predictors assessed in at least four study populations. For these predictors, we summarized how each predictor was defined and used vote counting and descriptive statistics to characterize overall trends.\n",

      "Results\n",

Studies were implemented in 12 countries between 1988 and 2021 and enrolled a total of 164,480 PLW at risk of acquiring HIV. Of the 66 predictors evaluated, 16 met our inclusion criteria. Estimated associations tended to be imprecise and variability in how predictors were measured precluded meta-analyses. We observed trends towards a higher risk of maternal HIV acquisition among young women and women who reported early coital debut, multiple partnerships, sexually transmitted infections, being unaware of partner HIV status, or having a partner living with HIV. In most studies, PLW in stable, monogamous relationships experienced a lower risk of acquiring HIV than those who were single, separated, or in a polygynous marriage. HIV risk perception, condom use, and vaginal drying were also commonly associated with HIV acquisition risk.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",

      "Cerebral blood flow at rest declines with age. However, age-related changes in functional measures of cerebrovascular health including cerebrovascular reactivity and neurovascular coupling are not well understood. Additionally, the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular function remains unclear. APOEε4 positive (APOEε4+; n = 37, age = 63±4y) and APOEε4 negative (APOEε4-; n = 50, age = 63±4y) cognitively unimpaired adults participated in this study. Macrovascular cerebral blood flow and microvascular cerebral perfusion were measured using 4D flow MRI and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI, respectively. Cerebrovascular reactivity and neurovascular coupling were assessed by measuring middle cerebral artery blood velocity in response to hypercapnia and the n-back test, respectively. Neurovascular coupling was lower in APOEε4+ compared with APOEε4- adults (P<0.05), despite higher cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia. Alterations in neurovascular coupling may occur early, prior to changes in cognition, in aging APOEε4 carriers.\n",

      "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the risk and predictive factors of splenic malignancy and hemangiosarcoma in dogs undergoing splenectomy at a surgical specialty clinic. Medical records, hematologic results, surgical reports, and histopathologic results from 182 dogs that underwent splenectomy for the treatment of splenic masses or nodules were reviewed retrospectively. The majority of dogs (57.7%) had benign splenic diagnoses with no malignancy. Hemangiosarcoma was diagnosed in 32.4% of the dogs. A final multivariable model indicated that thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a smaller diameter of the largest splenic nodule were risk factors for hemangiosarcoma (P<0.001), and hemoperitoneum (P = 0.01) was an additional risk factor when nodule diameter was not evaluated. There were 91 dogs that had hemoperitoneum, and 60.4% of those dogs had malignant splenic lesions. Of the 33 dogs that underwent a splenectomy for incidentally identified splenic lesions, 93.9% had benign splenic lesions. Breed size was not a significant predictor of splenic malignancy risk; however, all 6 of the German shepherds included in the study had a hemangiosarcoma diagnosis. Overall prevalence of splenic malignancy including HSA may be overestimated in some canine populations.\n",

The inadequate social support from family/relatives, neighbours, community and national policies such as maternity leave, alongside the absence of NGOs/INGOs support, put women at risk of poor mental health. In addition to the inadequate support, limited availability and accessibility of maternal health services potentially cause immense distress among pregnant women. Furthermore, in the context of a patriarchal society, the impact of socioeconomic and cultural context on pregnant women’s mental health is also presented as a major determinant of poor mental health among pregnant women.\n",

Healthcare providers in this study mainly used the overview page of the visual decision aids. Although this is valued by both providers and patients, it is also important to discuss the individual treatment pages, including the pros and cons, with patients. This study also points to differences between outpatient clinics or departments in the use and implementation of the visual decision aids. The visual decision aids for osteoarthritis are used to a limited extent. In nephrology clinics, the visual decision aid is implemented.\n",

      "This study identified and analyzed metaphors related to the lived experience of young-onset dementia that were used in nine illness narratives written by people with the condition. A final set of 1111 MEs sorted into 30 source domain categories were grouped according to six target domain categories reflecting the biologic (the person with dementia’s body/brain), psychologic (suffering with dementia, coping with dementia, dementia itself, the person with dementia), and social (the social experience of dementia) aspects of having dementia. Notably, many of the metaphors were similar to previously reported metaphors of illness, such as fight and journey, and other metaphors of embodiment, as well as disease as enemy, body as container, and body as machine. In addition, although negative conceptualizations were in the majority, almost one-third of the metaphoric expressions, belonging to the fight and journey source domain categories, reflected mainly positive images. The commonality of metaphor types with those of other illness experiences supports the notion of shared metaphors across illness contexts. Moreover, in contrast to the dehumanizing and stigmatizing terms that have previously been used to socially construct dementia, the positivity of metaphoric images identified here indicates the authors’ proactive and affirming conceptualizations of their experience of dementia. Health care professionals can draw on this study’s findings to help their own patients make sense of and cope with dementia.\n",

      "Radiomics offers a novel strategy for the differential diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and prediction of treatment responses in breast cancer. Studies have explored radiomic signatures from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM), but the diagnostic accuracy varies widely. To evaluate this performance, we conducted a meta-analysis performing a comprehensive literature search across databases including PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) until March 31, 2024. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Twenty-four eligible studies encompassing 5588 breast cancer patients were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77–0.84), specificity of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.81–0.87), PLR of 5.24 (95%CI: 4.32–6.34), NLR of 0.23 (95%CI: 0.19–0.27), DOR of 23.16 (95%CI: 17.20–31.19), and AUC of 0.90 (95%CI: 0.87–0.92), indicating good diagnostic performance. Significant heterogeneity was observed in analyses of sensitivity (I2 = 74.64%) and specificity (I2 = 83.18%). Spearman’s correlation coefficient suggested no significant threshold effect (P = 0.538). Meta-regression and subgroup analyses identified several potential heterogeneity sources, including data source, integration of clinical factors and peritumor features, MRI equipment, magnetic field strength, lesion segmentation, and modeling methods. In conclusion, DCE-MRI radiomic models exhibit good diagnostic performance in predicting ALNM and SLNM in breast cancer. This non-invasive and effective tool holds potential for the preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients.\n",

      "The common house mosquito Culex pipiens s.l., widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and North America has two recognized biotypes, Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and Cx. pipiens biotype molestus, which hybridize. Despite their morphological similarities, these biotypes may exhibit ecological differences. This complex ecological mosaic may affect the interaction of Cx. pipiens with pathogens like avian Plasmodium, which is transmitted to wildlife. Although the vector competence for Cx. pipiens biotype molestus has been well studied, there is a lack of studies comparing the vector competence of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and their hybrids for the transmission of avian Plasmodium. Here, we evaluated the vector competence of the Cx. pipiens biotypes pipiens, molestus and their hybrids for the transmission of two avian Plasmodium species. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on blood of wild infected birds and the presence of DNA of Plasmodium in head-thorax and saliva of mosquitoes was molecularly evaluated at 13 day-post exposure. The transmission rates (i.e., the detection of parasite DNA in mosquito saliva) for Plasmodium cathemerium were similar for the two biotypes of Cx. pipiens and their hybrids while Plasmodium relictum DNA was only found in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. In addition, P. cathemerium was significantly more prevalent than P. relictum in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. Our results suggest that avian Plasmodium is transmitted by both Cx. pipiens biotypes and their hybrids although differences could be found depending of the parasite species studied. Differences in the abundance of each biotype and their hybrids within areas characterized by distinct environmental conditions, along with variations in their blood-feeding patterns and the parasites infecting birds, could ultimately determine differences in the relevance of each Cx. pipiens biotype in the transmission of avian Plasmodium.\n",

      "Singapore has seen an increase in norovirus outbreaks in preschools from 2019 to 2022 primarily due to person-to-person transmission. This study describes the use of compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) modelling to simulate the spread of norovirus among preschool children in a classroom setting. Different intervention measures, such as isolation of infected preschoolers, handwashing and surface decontamination were modelled to quantify their effectiveness at reducing the number of children infected. We found that isolation of the sick child was the most effective single intervention to reduce transmission risk, which was 5 times more effective than handwashing. Coupled with handwashing and surface decontamination, transmission risk could be further reduced, close to zero. Findings from our study can be used to reiterate to parents and teachers on the importance of recognizing the symptoms exhibited by their unwell children and refraining from sending them to school, as this action poses a risk of transmitting norovirus to other children. In addition, our findings can be used to educate children and staff in preschools on the importance of practising good personal hygiene and regular environmental cleaning. Through this study, decision makers would be better informed on the effectivness of various risk mitigation measures at reduce the risk of norovirus transmission in preschool settings.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Currently, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging of choice for the differential diagnosis of various cystic lung lesions, including true cystic lung diseases (CLD) and lesions that may mimic them. However, the traditionally used inspiratory scan still presents a significant spectrum of overlapping radiological features. Recent studies have demonstrated variation in lesion size between inspiratory and expiratory phases, probably due to cyst-airway communication. In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review of paired inspiratory and expiratory HRCT in the assessment of cystic lesions as an additional tool to narrow the differential diagnosis.\n",

      "Methods\n",
      "A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, BVS, and Cochrane through August 2023. Full-text articles that performed paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans in adult patients with cystic lung lesions were included, with the outcome measured as the reduction in lesion size according to the respiratory phase. Diagnoses were confirmed through histopathological or radiological features.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "This study has suggested that paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans can be valuable for helping differentiate between emphysema and other diseases with a cystic pattern due to their ability to reveal dynamic properties of the lesions. However, the average reduction in cyst size as a single parameter is not sufficient for further refining diagnostics. Studies exploring advanced metrics to assess the reduction in lesion diameter emerge as potential opportunities to investigate the cyst-airway communication hypothesis and further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of paired methods.\n",

      "The removal of subgingival deposits, especially calculus, plays a crucial role in basic periodontal therapy. However, manual detection methods affect accuracy owing to the operator’s skill. To avoid this uncertainty, we have developed a calculus detection device named “Sensor probe” and evaluated its ability to detect calculus for future clinical applications. The Sensor probe consisted of a 635 nm-wavelength semiconductor laser and a 0.5 mm-diameter single-mode optical fiber. Initially, the performance of the device was evaluated using clinically obtained extracted teeth with calculus covered with a stainless-steel shielding plate with pinhole. Then, the effect of the optical fiber’s end shape on calculus detection performance was analyzed. Lastly, the performance of the Sensor probe was compared to that of a conventional periodontal probe in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for calculus detection using calculus-covered extracted teeth. The results indicated that Sensor probe detected dental calculus through the pinhole with a diameter of 300 μm or more when applied from a distance of 100 μm. The results analyzing the effect of the optical fiber’s end shape on calculus detection performance showed that cutting the fiber end at an angle of 45° resulted in the most effective calculus detection. This may be because the laser light refracted on the cut surface and concentrated on the fiber side. Moreover, by comparing the performance of this device to a conventional periodontal probe revealed that the Sensor probe showed improved calculus detection accuracy in deeper periodontal pockets. This improvement was particularly significant in the apical third, where detection is typically difficult. In conclusion, a Sensor probe that uses an optical fiber with a 45° angled end may facilitate subgingival calculus detection. In future clinical applications, Sensor probes could lead to more accurate and efficient calculus removal, especially for deeper periodontal pockets.\n",

      "Sibling sexual behaviour, despite historical and cross-cultural incest taboos and biologically driven incest avoidance, poses a persistent problem. We tested factors theorized to be associated with sibling incest in a cross-sectional online survey of 1,863 respondents with siblings mainly from North America and Germany. We found that 13% of participants reported engaging in sexual contact with a sibling, typically starting at the age of 10, and that step-siblings and half-siblings were more likely to engage in sibling incest than full siblings. Curiosity and games were the primary motivators; being coerced was more prevalent among female and younger participants. The study underscores both individual (e.g., impulsivity, concurrent childhood sexual behaviour problems) and family level factors (e.g., presence of step-sibling, positive attitudes toward nudity, sexual abuse by parent) influencing liability to engage in sexual behaviours with a sibling. Findings were robust across English- and German-speaking participants, suggesting our results are generalizable. Professionals addressing problematic child sexual behaviour should assess for concurrent sibling incest, and evaluate positive family attitudes towards nudity, sexual abuse by parents, and reduced disgust to sibling incest as potential risk factors for sibling incest. The findings stress the need for comprehensive sexual education in blended households, where age gaps and diminished genetic relatedness contribute to sibling sexual behaviour.\n",

      "Evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination of animals against rabies is not routinely implemented. In cases where it is carried out, the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) or the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test are the recommended tests. However, both of these tests require handling of live rabies virus (RABV), and are cumbersome to perform. In view of this, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been proposed as a surrogate test; however, availability of appropriate antigen is a major impediment for the development of ELISAs to detect anti-rabies antibodies. The most widely used antigen is the RABV glycoprotein (G) purified from cell culture-propagated virus, which requires a biosafety level 3 containment. The alternative is to use recombinantly expressed G, which needs to be to be properly glycosylated and folded to serve as the best antigen. The most suitable system for its production is the baculovirus expression system (BVES). However, purification of RABV G is challenging. We therefore tested partially purified preparations in the form of extracts of insect cells infected with baculovirus expressing RABV G, against sera from vaccinated dogs in an indirect ELISA. The results showed good concordance against RFFIT, with sensitivity and specificity of 90.48% and 80.00%, respectively. The system may be used for quick screening to determine the presence and an approximate level of antibodies, and can be modified to enable monitoring of mass dog vaccination programs, as well as to facilitate certification of dogs intended for international travel and transportation.\n",

      "It is important to establish the relationship between appropriate nutritional intake and improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) in elderly hospitalized patients. This prospective observational study aimed to investigate diet order compliance (DOC) during 8 weeks of hospitalization and calculate the odds of improved functional independence measure (FIM) scores for high- and low-DOC groups using covariate-adjusted models in geriatric convalescent hospitals. The study subjects were elderly inpatients (>65 years old) with degenerative disease who consumed prescribed oral meals (Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) = 6/7) and who did not receive physical/occupational therapy. The personalized diet order was prescript, and the DOC was calculated using dietitian-monitored daily intake data. The 73 patients were divided into a low-DOC group (< 84.0%, n = 35) and a high-DOC group (≥ 84.0%, n = 38) on the basis of the median DOC (84.0%, average for 8 weeks). Twenty (52.6%) high-DOC patients and nine (25.7%) low-DOC patients experienced motor-FIM improvements (P = 0.017). After 8 weeks, the change in motor-FIM in the high-DOC group (1.6±0.3) was greater than that in the low-DOC group (0.3±0.1; P = 0.001). According to the baseline and nutrition-intake-adjusted model of multiple logistic regression analysis, in the high-DOC group, the motor-FIM improvement OR was 5.102 (95% CI: 1.100–16.233, P = 0.036), and the total-FIM improvement OR was 5.273 (95% CI: 1.102–25.238, P = 0.037). High compliance with individualized nutritional prescriptions can increase FIM scores in clinical settings. Thus, comprehensive approaches to increase dietary compliance are needed for elderly long-term care patients.\n",

On CEUS with CVI, complex intratumoral and peripheral vessels were frequent in HCCs (100% of HCCs, 46.2% of non-HCC malignancies, and 70.0% of benign tumors), while detour vessels were frequent in non-HCC malignancies (none of HCCs, 53.8% of non-HCC malignancies, and 10.0% of benign tumors) (p<0.001). The mean velocity of HCC (26.3 mm/s) was the highest, while that of non-HCC malignancy (20.6 mm/s) was the lowest (p<0.001).

      "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants presents challenges to vaccine effectiveness, underlining the necessity for next-generation vaccines with multiple antigens beyond the spike protein. Here, we investigated a multiantigenic booster containing spike and a chimeric construct composed of nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) proteins, comparing its efficacy to a spike-only booster against Omicron BA.5 in K18-hACE2 mice. Initially, mice were primed and boosted with Beta (B.1.351) spike-only mRNA, showing strong spike-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies, albeit with limited cross-neutralization to Omicron variants. Subsequently, a spike-NM multiantigenic vaccine was then examined as a second booster dose for protection in hACE2-transgenic mice. Mice receiving either homologous spike-only or heterologous spike-NM booster had nearly complete inhibition of infectious virus shedding in oral swabs and reduced viral burdens in both lung and nasal tissues following BA.5 challenge. Examination of lung pathology further revealed that both spike-only and spike-NM boosters provided comparable protection against inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis. Moreover, the spike-NM booster demonstrated neutralization efficacy in a pseudovirus assay against Wuhan-Hu-1, Beta, and Omicron variants akin to the spike-only booster. These findings indicate that supplementing spike with additional SARS-CoV-2 targets in a booster immunization confers equivalent immunity and protection against Omicron BA.5. This work highlights a promising strategy for individuals previously vaccinated with spike-only vaccines, potentially offering enhanced protection against emerging coronaviruses.\n",

      "Cancer cells are known to express the Warburg effect—increased glycolysis and formation of lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen—as well as high glutamine uptake. In tumors, cancer cells are surrounded by collagen, immune cells, and neoangiogenesis. Whether collagen formation, neoangiogenesis, and inflammation in cancer are associated with the Warburg effect needs to be established. Metabolic modelling has proven to be a tool of choice to understand biological reality better and make in silico predictions. Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs) are essential for conducting an unbiased decomposition of a metabolic model into its minimal functional units. EFMs can be investigated using our tool, aspefm, an innovative approach based on logic programming where biological constraints can be incorporated. These constraints allow networks to be characterized regardless of their size. Using a metabolic model of the human cell containing collagen, neoangiogenesis, and inflammation markers, we derived a subset of EFMs of biological relevance to the Warburg effect. Within this model, EFMs analysis provided more adequate results than parsimonious flux balance analysis and flux sampling. Upon further inspection, the EFM with the best linear regression fit to cancer cell lines exometabolomics data was selected. The minimal pathway, presenting the Warburg effect, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and release of inflammation markers, showed that collagen production was possible directly de novo from glutamine uptake and without extracellular import of glycine and proline, collagen’s main constituents.\n",

      "To use phages in a personalized therapy and industrial applications, an accurate quantification is needed. The gold standard method, namely the culture-based double agar overlay (DAO) method, provides an accurate estimate of the number of infectious phages but is laborious and time-intensive. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) can be used as a fast alternative but tends to overestimate the number of infectious phage particles. Here we describe the use of a DNase treatment before quantification of the Staphylococcus aureus phage ISP with qPCR to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of infectious phage particles. We showed that DNase treatment results in a significant decrease of the concentration when measured with qPCR although for two out of three tested ISP phage stocks, there was still a significant difference with the DAO method. We also showed that the discrepancy between quantification with qPCR and the DAO method is dependent on the storage period of the phage stock, with a larger discrepancy for older stocks. Additionally, we used negative contrast immune electron microscopy to confirm the presence of DNA in the medium of the phage stock and the impact of the DNase treatment on the free DNA.\n",

Qualitatively, Medenes and Begait, cattle breeds from lowland agroecology and livestock-based production systems, possess a convex facial profile, relatively larger dewlap, naval flap, and perpetual sheath, as well as more uniform and lighter body colors than the Adwa and Arado cattle breeds, which are from the midland agroecology and mixed crop–livestock production systems. Morphometrically, clear differences were observed among all of the studied cattle breeds, where the Begait, Medenes, Arado, and Adwa cattle breeds were ordered in descending order according to their overall body size. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed significant differences among the breeds where each breed was placed under a separate group. However, such phenotypic distinctions among the four cattle breeds do not necessarily indicate genetic dissimilarities. Therefore, further inclusive genetic characterization studies involving the use of representative samples from the Adwa and Medenes cattle breeds are recommended to quantify the degree of genetic relationships among these breeds. Moreover, owing to the unknown breed-level population size, urgent conservation programs as well as genetic improvement strategies are needed to ensure sustainable utilization.\n",

      "The ability to conceptualize numerical quantities is an essential human trait. According to the “Triple Code Model” in numerical cognition, distinct neural substrates encode the processing of visual, auditory, and non-symbolic numerical representations. While our contemporary understanding of human number cognition has benefited greatly from advances in clinical imaging, limited studies have investigated the intracranial electrophysiological correlates of number processing. In this study, 13 subjects undergoing stereotactic electroencephalography for epilepsy participated in a number recognition task. Drawing upon postulates of the Triple Code Model, we presented subjects with numerical stimuli varying in representation type (symbolic vs. non-symbolic) and mode of stimuli delivery (visual vs. auditory). Time-frequency spectrograms were dimensionally reduced with principal component analysis and passed into a linear support vector machine classification algorithm to identify regions associated with number perception compared to inter-trial periods. Across representation formats, the highest classification accuracy was observed in the bilateral parietal lobes. Auditory (spoken and beeps) and visual (Arabic) number formats preferentially engaged the superior temporal cortices and the frontoparietal regions, respectively. The left parietal cortex was found to have the highest classification for number dots. Notably, the putamen exhibited robust classification accuracies in response to numerical stimuli. Analyses of spectral feature maps revealed that non-gamma frequency, below 30 Hz, had greater-than-chance classification value and could be potentially used to characterize format specific number representations. Taken together, our findings obtained from intracranial recordings provide further support and expand on the Triple Code Model for numerical cognition.\n",

      "The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding significantly within medical research and, to some extent, in clinical practice. Deep learning (DL) applications, which use large convolutional neural networks (CNN), hold considerable potential, especially in optimizing radiological evaluations. However, training DL algorithms to clinical standards requires extensive datasets, and their processing is labor-intensive. In this study, we developed an annotation tool named DLLabelsCT that utilizes CNN models to accelerate the image analysis process. To validate DLLabelsCT, we trained a CNN model with a ResNet34 encoder and a UNet decoder to segment the pancreas on an open-access dataset and used the DL model to assist in annotating a local dataset, which was further used to refine the model. DLLabelsCT was also tested on two external testing datasets. The tool accelerates annotation by 3.4 times compared to a completely manual annotation method. Out of 3,715 CT scan slices in the testing datasets, 50% did not require editing when reviewing the segmentations made by the ResNet34-UNet model, and the mean and standard deviation of the Dice similarity coefficient was 0.82±0.24. DLLabelsCT is highly accurate and significantly saves time and resources. Furthermore, it can be easily modified to support other deep learning models for other organs, making it an efficient tool for future research involving larger datasets.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "In Ethiopia, Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) was integrated into the existing Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system in 2014. Despite providing valuable evidence to inform policies and actions, system implementation has not been evaluated. Thus, a national-level evaluation was conducted to assess the level and status of system implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "A national cross-sectional study was conducted using a multi-stage sampling approach in 2020. A total of 629 health facilities were included in the study. A modified tool, adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was employed to assess each functional component of the system, encompassing structure, core, supportive, and system attributes. The score for each component was based on Ethiopian Public Health Institute’s mid-term evaluation metrics. To objectively evaluate the implementation status, a composite score of the Maternal Death Surveillance and Response Performance Index (MDSRPI) was calculated based on five performance indicators. Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction were used to examine the variations in scores among the different characteristics.\n",

      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Of the total sample size, 82.5% (519/629) of health facilities were assessed. Among the assessed health facilities, 77.0% (400/519) fulfilled the criteria for final analysis. Accordingly, the overall readiness score was 44.9% (95% CI: 43.9% to 45.9%), which is rated as less functional. The structures of the system were rated at 51.7% (95% CI: 49.9% to 53.4%), and the system attributes were rated at 69.6% (95% CI: 68.0% to 71.2%), which were considered fairly functional. In contrast, the core functions were rated at 20.0% (95% CI: 18.9% to 21.1%), and the supportive functions were rated at 38.4% (95% CI: 36.4% to 40.4%), which were categorized as not functioning and less functional, respectively. Regionally, Tigray’s overall readiness score (54.8%, 95% CI: 50.4–59.1%) was significantly higher than Oromia (41.6%, 95% CI: 40.2–43.0%, P = 0.0001), Amhara (47.7%, 95% CI: 43.9–45.9%, P = 0.05), and SNNPR (42.3%, 95% CI: 39.3–45.3, P = 0.0001). Additionally, Amhara’s score was significantly higher than Oromia and SNNPR. Secondary-level healthcare facilities (49.6%, 95% CI: 45.7–53.7, P = 0.029) had a significantly higher readiness score compared to primary health facilities (44.6%, 95% CI: 43.5–45.6).

      "Background\n",
      "In clinical research, the most appropriate way to assess the effect of an intervention is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the field of rare diseases, conducting an RCT is challenging, resulting in a low rate of clinical trials, with a high frequency of early termination and unpublished trials. The aim of the EPISTOP trial was to compare outcomes in infants with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who received vigabatrin preventively before the seizures onset with those who received it conventionally after. The study was designed as a prospective, multicentre, randomized clinical trial. However, ethics committees at four centres did not approve this RCT design, resulting in an open-label trial (OLT) in these four centres and an RCT in the other six centres. In this paper, we re-analyse the data from the EPISTOP trial using methods to investigate the influence of allocation bias on the results of the EPISTOP trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method\n",
      "A bias-corrected analysis is used to support and strengthen the published results. We included a term representing the effect of selection bias as an influencing factor on the corresponding endpoint in the statistical model. Thus, the treatment effect estimates for the primary endpoint of time to first seizure and additional secondary endpoints are adjusted for the bias effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Result\n",
      "The bias-corrected analyses for the primary endpoint show that the estimated hazard ratio and associated confidence intervals are in a very similar range (original analysis: HR 2.91, 95%-CI [1.11 to 7.67], p-value 0.0306; bias-corrected analysis: HR 2.89, 95%-CI [1.10 to 7.58], p-value 0.0316).

However, this highlights that this aspect needs to be considered in future trials, especially in rare diseases, to avoid additional biases in an already small sample size where it may be difficult to reach significance.\n",

      "To find an effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2, Quercetin’s chemical structure was compared to nine ligands associated with nine key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. It was found that Quercetin closely resembles Remdesivir, the co-crystallized ligand of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This similarity was confirmed through flexible alignment experiments and molecular docking studies, which showed that both Quercetin and Remdesivir bind similarly to the active site of RdRp. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a 200 ns trajectory, analyzing various factors like RMSD, RG, RMSF, SASA, and hydrogen bonding were conducted. These simulations gave detailed insights into the binding interactions of Quercetin with RdRp compared to Remdesivir. Further analyses, including MM-GBSA, Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints (ProLIF) and Profile PLIP studies, confirmed the stability of Quercetin’s binding. Principal component analysis of trajectories (PCAT) provided insights into the coordinated movements within the systems studied. In vitro assays showed that Quercetin is highly effective in inhibiting RdRp, with an IC50 of 122.1 ±5.46 nM, which is better than Remdesivir’s IC50 of 21.62 ±2.81 μM. Moreover, Quercetin showed greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 In vitro, with an IC50 of 1.149 μg/ml compared to Remdesivir’s 9.54 μg/ml. The selectivity index (SI) values highlighted Quercetin’s safety margin (SI: 791) over Remdesivir (SI: 6). In conclusion, our comprehensive study suggests that Quercetin is a promising candidate for further research as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, providing valuable insights for developing an effective anti-COVID-19 treatment.\n",

      "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) before 37 weeks of gestation is a common obstetrical event, whose pathophysiology is still poorly understood. Our objective was to study the mechanical strength of fetal membranes in women with a clinical risk factor for preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).\n",

      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We included, in a prospective, descriptive, single-center study, patients scheduled for cesarean section at term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation). For each patient, we performed uniaxial tensile tests on fetal membranes with a universal testing machine equipped with a force sensor (EZ20®, Lloyds), allowing the recording of an applied force/time curve. We collected maximum force (Fmax), maximum stress (σMax), and Young’s modulus of elasticity. The thickness of each membrane sample was also measured. We compared the values obtained according to certain clinical risk factors for PPROM such as age, body mass index, gravidity, parity, a history of PPROM or preterm birth, smoking, gestational diabetes, geographic origin, and socioeconomic level.\n",

      "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disability characterized by a range of brain- and body-based difficulties which, when left unsupported, can lead to experiences of significant adversity across the lifespan. Caregivers of individuals with FASD play a critical role in advocating and supporting healthy outcomes for individuals with FASD, and most caregiver research to date has been focused on stressors and challenges. Very few studies have been conducted to systematically capture the full experience of caring for someone with FASD across the lifespan, including perspectives, concerns, as well as strengths and successes of caregivers and their families. Collaborative research with individuals with living experience is essential for understanding needs and supporting healthy outcomes for individuals with FASD and their families, and caregivers are in a unique and important position to provide perspectives and share living expertise. Therefore, the current study was developed collaboratively with caregivers and researchers to capture the many aspects of caregivers’ contexts, concerns, needs, and successes in raising individuals with FASD. In this study protocol paper, we describe the rationale, development, design, and anticipated impacts of this research. The goal of this paper is to share information about why and how this study is being done, and potentially guide other teams in developing similar projects to better understand caregivers’ experiences, needs, and successes. Documenting and giving voice to the breadth and depth of caregiver experiences will help us to tailor services and supports, develop resources, stimulate knowledge translation based in resilience and protective factors, guide future studies, and inform evidence-based policy initiatives.\n",

In contrast, no statistically significant difference in the genotypes of CD40L (rs1126535) was detected between laryngeal cancer patients and the control group (p = 0.12). Additionally, no significant differences in serum sCD40 or sCD40L levels were observed between the groups (p = 0.48 and p = 0.15, respectively). However, a moderate positive correlation was found between sCD40 and sCD40L levels in the laryngeal cancer group (r = 0.52, p<0.01), a relationship that was not observed in the control group.\n",

      "According to the current findings, it is suggested that the CD40 (rs1883832) gene variation found in patients may indicate an individual’s susceptibility to developing laryngeal cancer. On the other hand, CD40L (rs1126535) seems to not play a significant role. While serum sCD40 and sCD40L levels did not show significant differences between patients and controls, the correlation in cancer patients suggests that these markers may be relevant in tumor progression. Further research is required to clarify the functional implications of these genetic variants and their potential use as biomarkers for laryngeal cancer.\n",

      "Disease burden associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in low- and middle-income countries has been on an increasing trend in the past decades. Despite the worldwide genetic, cultural, and environmental variations in determinants of CVDs, few studies have attempted the identification of risk factors of CVDs in low- and middle-income countries. This article aims to introduce the Khánh Hòa Cardiovascular Study, a prospective cohort study among middle-aged community dwellers in rural Khánh Hòa, Vietnam. A total of 3000 individuals, aged 40–60 years at baseline, participated in the baseline survey conducted from June 2019 to June 2020 and will be followed up for the subsequent 10 years. The baseline survey collected information on sociodemographic variables, disease history, lifestyle, social environment, and mental health via questionnaires, physical examinations, and biochemical measurements. Information on the incidence of severe health outcomes (i.e., mortality, CVDs, and cancer) has been and will be collected using a study-specific disease registry. Results showed that the prevalences of excess body weight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were 25.9%, 39.6%, 10.2%, and 45.1%, respectively. Furthermore, by March 2023, 21 participants had died, including 5 CVD deaths and 12 cancer deaths. Moreover, we recorded 22 and 31 cases of nonfatal CVDs and cancer, respectively. These results suggest that many rural residents in Vietnam have high cardiometabolic risk, and underscore the importance of advancing research to identify risk factors and prevent the onset of serious health events.\n",

      "This study examines the relationship between virtual social interaction and people’s social behaviors and psychology using algorithm matching technologies and questionnaire surveys. The focus is on interpersonal communication on virtual social platforms. The findings indicate that engaging in virtual social networking is often accompanied by a high level of loneliness. Users who experience social anxiety in the real world tend to feel more lonely, and this loneliness is exacerbated by presenting an unreal version of oneself and having distrust in virtual social networking. Users with higher anxiety and loneliness levels are more likely to use the algorithm matching function of virtual social networking, engage in false self-presentation, and have less trust in the platform. Since the inherent flaws of virtual social networking cannot be eliminated solely through algorithm matching, a potential solution is to introduce more offline to online social functions for strangers. This exploration of actual matching on social platforms may help reduce users’ loneliness.\n",

      "In modern medical imaging-assisted therapies, manual annotation is commonly employed for liver and tumor segmentation in abdominal CT images. However, this approach suffers from low efficiency and poor accuracy. With the development of deep learning, automatic liver tumor segmentation algorithms based on neural networks have emerged, for the improvement of the work efficiency. However, existing liver tumor segmentation algorithms still have several limitations: (1) they often encounter the common issue of class imbalance in liver tumor segmentation tasks, where the tumor region is significantly smaller than the normal tissue region, causing models to predict more negative samples and neglect the tumor region; (2) they fail to adequately consider feature fusion between global contexts, leading to the loss of crucial information; (3) they exhibit weak perception of local details such as fuzzy boundaries, irregular shapes, and small lesions, thereby failing to capture important features. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Axis Attention Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, referred to as MA-cGAN. Firstly, we propose the Multi-Axis attention mechanism (MA) that projects three-dimensional CT images along different axes to extract two-dimensional features. The features from different axes are then fused by using learnable factors to capture key information from different directions. Secondly, the MA is incorporated into a U-shaped segmentation network as the generator to enhance its ability to extract detailed features. Thirdly, a conditional generative adversarial network is built by combining a discriminator and a generator to enhance the stability and accuracy of the generator’s segmentation results. The MA-cGAN was trained and tested on the LiTS public dataset for the liver and tumor segmentation challenge. Experimental results show that MA-cGAN improves the Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, average surface distance, and other metrics compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation models. The segmented liver and tumor models have clear edges, fewer false positive regions, and are closer to the true labels, which plays an active role in medical adjuvant therapy. The source code with our proposed model are available at https://github.com/jhliao0525/MA-cGAN.git.\n",

      "Embryonic development in humans is controlled by the Hedgehog pathway, which becomes inactive in mature tissues. Except for tissue maintenance and healing, activation of this pathway results in tumorigenesis with only a few exceptions. The drugs currently in use have shown no effectiveness in blocking the key proteins responsible for tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is crucial to find new inhibitors that can stop the abnormal activation of the pathway. A preliminary Insilco screening of naturally occurring compounds was carried out to identify potential inhibitors of the pathway. Docking of seventeen naturally occurring antitumorigenic compounds against the four key proteins of the regulatory proteins of the Hedgehog pathway using AutoDock v4.2.6 software was carried out. Liriodenine exhibited the strongest binding affinity towards three out of the four regulatory proteins (-7.61 kcal/mol with Smoothened, -8.14 kcal/mol with Patched-I, and -6.15 kcal/mol with Gli-II) of the Hedgehog pathway, whereas 2’,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxychalcone displayed the highest binding affinity of -7.04 kcal/mol with the Sonic Hedgehog protein. Additional molecular dynamic simulation was conducted using Gromacs with Liriodenine and 2’,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxy chalcone. Every protein-ligand complex underwent simulation using v5.1.4 software for a duration of 100 nanoseconds. The findings from the simulation indicate that Liriodenine and 2’,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxy chalcone form a strong bond with their corresponding protein. Our findings show that the two aforementioned molecules have potential as new inhibitors of the pathway and should be further investigated in both invitro and in vivo experiments.\n",

      "Ammonia is widely acknowledged to be a stressor and one of the most detrimental gases in animal enclosures. In livestock- and poultry-breeding facilities, a precise, rapid, and affordable method for detecting ammonia concentrations is essential. We design and develop an electronic nose system containing a bionic chamber that imitates the nasal-cavity structure of humans and canines. The sensors are positioned based on fluid simulation results. Response data for ammonia and ethanol gases and the response/ recovery times of an ammonia sensor under three concentrations are collected using the electronic nose system. Response data are classified and regressed using a sparrow search algorithm (SSA)-optimized backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The results show that the sensor has a relative mean deviation of 1.45%. The ammonia sensor’s output voltage is 1.3–2.05 V when the ammonia concentration ranges from 15 to 300 ppm. The ethanol gas sensor’s output voltage is 1.89–3.15 V when the ethanol gas concentration ranges from 8 to 200 ppm. The average response time of the ammonia sensor in the chamber is 13 s slower than that of the sensor directly exposed to the gas being measured, while the average recovery time is 19 s faster. In tests comparing the performance of the SSA-BPNN, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models, the SSA-BPNN achieves a 99.1% classification accuracy, better than the SVM and RF models. It also outperforms the other models at regression prediction, with smaller absolute, mean absolute, and root mean square errors. Its coefficient of determination (R2) is greater than 0.99, surpassing those of the SVM and RF models. The theoretical and experimental results both indicate that the proposed electronic nose system containing a bionic chamber, when used with the SSA-BPNN, offers a promising approach for detecting ammonia in livestock- and poultry-breeding facilities.\n",

      "Flaviviruses are a diverse group of RNA viruses known for their significant impact on human health worldwide. We generated a series of reporters that included cleavage sequences from the dengue virus type 2 polyprotein and co-transfected with plasmids encoding various flavivirus proteases into Aedes aegypti cells, followed by fluorescent imaging and western blot analysis for the determination of proteolytic cleavage. Recombinant flavivirus NS2B3 proteases from medically significant and insect-specific flaviviruses were able to process reporters encoding cleavage sequences from the dengue virus type 2 polyprotein in vitro including proteases from dengue virus types 1–4, Zika virus, yellow fever virus, Aedes flavivirus, and cell-fusing agent virus. Reporters were not cleaved when transfected cells were infected with dengue virus type 2. Endoplasmic reticulum tethered reporters were also cleaved by protease alone but not by infectious virus. These results shed light on the ability of multiple flavivirus proteases to cleave sequences derived from outside of their genome and raise new questions concerning the requirements for effective cleavage by flavivirus proteases in trans.\n",

In East African countries, particularly Rwanda, there is a known prevalence of low sodium intake, with a mean sodium intake of 1.6 g/day. However, despite this dietary habit, the national protocol for treating hypertension, as well as common clinical practice, often fail to account for the low salt intake in Rwandan communities. Hypertensive patients are still frequently advised to reduce their salt intake, and in some cases, they are instructed to eliminate salt entirely.\n",

      "Detection of Strogyloides-specific IgG antibodies in urine and serum has been used in diagnostic and epidemiological studies on strongyloidiasis. However, the usefulness of these assays in assessing responses to anthelmintic treatment is unclear. Thus, we evaluated the diagnostic performance and temporal profiles of Strongyloides-specific IgG antibodies in a cohort of participants at baseline and post-treatment. The participants were prospectively screened for baseline parasitic infections by fecal examination [agar plate culture technique (APCT) and formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT)] and digital droplet polymerase reaction (ddPCR) for Strongyloides stercoralis. At each sampling point, Strongyloides-specific IgG in urine and serum were measured by an in-house S. ratti-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At baseline, 169 of 351 participants (48.1%) had S. stercoralis infection by the combined fecal examination and ddPCR. The diagnostic sensitivities of IgG in urine and serum were 91.1% and 88.2%, respectively. The participants were given treatment with a single oral dose of ivermectin (IVM, 200 μg/kg) and were followed up by fecal and immunological diagnosis at 3 to 18 months post-treatment. The cure rate of IVM treatment evaluated by APCT and ddPCR was 88.3% at three months post-treatment. The profiles of IgG in urine in the curative treatment group showed a significant trend of decline with time post-treatment (Kruskal-Wallis test = 113.4–212.6, p value < 0.0001) and the lowest levels were seen 12 months post-treatment. The treatment response (> 50% reduction in urinary IgG antibody units) was 100%, and conversion from positive to negative results was 65.4%. The treatment response and conversion to negative assessed by serum IgG-ELISA were similar to those by urine IgG-ELISA. The results from this long-term diagnostic study highlight the utility of urinary IgG and serum IgG for screening and monitoring treatment outcomes in strongyloidiasis.\n",

      "This study aimed to discuss the pathogenic hereditary factors of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in Guangxi, China. We recruited 89 patients with SRNS or infantile NS from five major pediatric nephrology centers in Guangxi, and conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data. Whole-exome sequencing analysis was also performed on all patients. The risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. The study included 69 male and 20 female participants from 86 distinct families, with the median age of disease onset being 48 months (interquartile range: 24–93). Overall, 24.7% had a family history of SRNS, whereas 13.5% exhibited extra-kidney manifestations. We identified disease-causing variants in 24.7% (22/89) of patients across eight screened genes. The most frequently detected variant was found in COL4A5, followed by NPHS2 (5.6%), NPHS1 (2.2%), PAX2 (2.2%), WT1 (1.1%), LMX1B (1.1%), NUP105 (1.1%), and COL4A6 (1.1%). Twelve of the 26 pathogenic variants were determined to be de novo. Based on gene detection results, pathogenic variants were categorized into two groups: identified and unidentified variants. The identified variant group demonstrated a significant association with positive family history, steroid resistant-style, and response to immune therapy (P<0.001). Patients with the identified genetic variant were approximately ten times more likely to develop CKD (P<0.001) than those in the unidentified group at the last follow-up. Kidney biopsy was performed on 66 patients, and minimal change disease was the most prevalent histopathological diagnosis (29 cases; 32.6%). These findings suggest that children diagnosed with SRNS exhibit a diverse range of genetic alterations. We identified the COL4A5 variant as the predominant genetic abnormality and a low frequency of NPHS1 gene involvement in these children. Gene variants may serve as an independent predictor for SRNS progression to CKD.\n",

      "With increasing life expectancy, knee pain has become more prevalent, highlighting the need for early prediction. Although X-rays are commonly used for diagnosis, knee pain and X-ray findings do not always match. This study aims to identify factors contributing to knee pain in individuals with both normal and abnormal knee X-ray results to bridge the gap between X-ray findings and knee pain. Data from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), collected from 2010 to 2012, including data from 5,191 participants, were analyzed. The focus was on epidemiological characteristics, medical histories, knee pain, and X-ray grades. Multivariate logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were used to predict knee pain in individuals with normal and abnormal knee X-rays, categorized by Kellgren-Lawrence grades. For normal X-rays, the logistic regression model identified aging, being female, higher BMI, lower fat percentage, osteoporosis, depression, and rural living as factors associated with knee pain. The XGBoost model highlighted BMI, age, and sex as key predictors, with a feature importance >0.1. For abnormal X-rays, logistic regression indicated that aging, being female, higher BMI, osteoporosis, depression, and rural living were associated with knee pain. The XGBoost model highlighted age, BMI, sex, and osteoporosis as key predictors, with a feature importance >0.1. Aging and being female were associated with knee pain due to hormonal changes in women, as well as cartilage and bone deterioration. Lower fat percentage was significantly associated with increased pain, which might be attributable to higher activity levels. Higher BMI and osteoporosis were significantly associated with knee pain, possibly due to increased stress and reduced resistance on knee structures, respectively. Depression was identified as a key predictor of knee pain in patients with normal X-rays, potentially attributable to psychosomatic factors. The study’s limitations include its cross-sectional nature, which does not allow for the establishment of causal relationships, the lack of detailed medical history such as trauma history, and recall bias due to self-reported questionnaires. Future research should address these limitations to support our hypothesis.\n",

      "In a world rapidly transitioning, food consumption away from home is rising, therefore representing an increasing share of individual’s diet. Food consumed away from home negatively impacts diet, nutritional status and consequently has detrimental effects on health. In some contexts, where individual level dietary intake surveys are not regularly conducted, this behavior is not well documented leading to a gap of knowledge. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate in Burkina Faso and Vietnam specific modules that could be added to Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys that are usually regularly conducted worldwide, in order to document the economic and nutritional importance of food consumption away from home. In each country, two survey modules, one long (100 food items) and one short (30 food items) were developed, to measure individual-level food consumption away from home over the last 7 days. The modules were relatively validated in comparison with data from three non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls conducted over the same 7-days period. The validation was conducted in different settings (urban, peri-urban and rural) in Burkina Faso (n = 924) and Vietnam (n = 918). In both countries, a good concordance between the 24-hour dietary recalls and the modules in their ability to identify a person as having consumed food away from home (>77%) was found. However, in both countries, both modules underestimate the mean energy intake coming from foods consumed away from home (from 122 to 408 kcal) while they overestimate the budget allocated to it (from -0.07 to -0.29 USD/day). None of developed food away from home modules were considered as valid. There is a need for the international community to continue to work on developing and validating tools capable to estimate nutritional intakes related to food consumption away from home and that could be added to regular national household-level surveys.\n",

      "The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in influencing various physiological processes and maintaining overall well-being, including the gastric system. Current diagnostic tests for gastric diseases often involve invasive procedures, sampling limitations, and medication effects, leading to potential diagnostic errors and discomfort to patients. Considering the connection between oral and gastric microbiomes, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the diagnostic potential of the oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing upper digestive endoscopy. Oral samples from 266 participants across two Brazilian sites (Belterra and Sao Paulo) were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analysis to identify microbiome composition across endoscopy outcome groups, exploring alpha and beta-diversity, richness, and differential abundance and prevalence. Prevotella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and Streptococcus were the most abundant genera observed. No significant associations were found between alpha diversity profiles and endoscopy outcomes; beta diversity analyses similarly showed no correlations. Overall, the study did not establish the oral microbiome as a reliable marker for gastric health, underscoring the necessity for broader studies in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tests.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Alopecia Areata (AA) is an autoimmune condition where the activation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses is known to stimulate other white blood cells, potentially affecting hematopoietic lineages. However, previous studies on AA have found no utility in hematological ratios. Our goals were to compare neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), eosinophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (ELR), eosinophils-to-neutrophils ratio (ENR), and eosinophils-to-monocytes ratio (EMR) between patients with AA and controls, as well as between mild and moderate-severe AA cases.\n",

      "Methods and findings\n",
      "We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study involving adult patients enrolled in the largest national health maintenance organization in Israel. The study comprised 147,020 AA patients and 141,598 healthy controls. AA patients exhibited a higher likelihood of elevated NLR and ELR compared to controls. Upon further classification based on severity, moderate-severe AA patients displayed higher values of NLR, PLR, ELR, and EMR compared to mild AA individuals OR = 1.11 [1.09–1.1], P<0.001; OR = 1.09 [1.05–1.13], P<0.001; OR = 2.06 [1.67–2.53], P<0.001; OR = 1.07 [1.03–1.07)], P<0.001, respectively).

      "Context\n",
      "The COVID-19 emergency warrants reflection on how to improve future infectious disease pandemic preparedness and response (PPR). U.S. States took diverse approaches to COVID-19, with Florida’s approach characterized by fewer restrictions on businesses and individuals. Despite the profound effects of the pandemic, there is a dearth of stakeholder-informed recommendations for PPR at the state level. This study aims to empirically examine stakeholder perspectives on PPR in Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with former and current leaders from government, academia, and the private sector in Florida. Participants were asked about challenges encountered during COVID-19 and considerations for what should be done for future pandemics. Interview transcripts and notes were analyzed using qualitative content analysis (QCA).\n",

      "Findings\n",
      "Results were organized into four main categories (recommendations for future actions, challenges in PPR, successes and failures during the COVID-19 response), across which six sub-categories were identified: public health systems capacities; mitigation of disease transmission; roles and relationships; messaging and information dissemination; minimizing other adverse effects of a pandemic; and public health culture. Considering the neglect of existing pandemic plans and jurisdictional tensions around decision-making during COVID-19, participants proposed implementing a pandemic playbook that delineates the responsibilities of relevant agencies and processes of waiving standard procedures. While many suggested closures and restrictions to avoid the spread of disease, others questioned the extent to which such strategies should be implemented.\n",

Participants defined successful pandemic response as not only comprising the mitigation of disease transmission, but also the minimization of adverse social and economic effects. Participants discussed strategies for a unified, well-coordinated approach to future pandemics that balances health and economic concerns.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecologic malignancies. Despite recent advancements in targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors, recurrence is common and frequently resistant to existing therapies. A powerful diagnostic tool, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of its implications, is crucial. HE4, a clinical serum biomarker for ovarian cancer, has shown efficacy in monitoring malignant phenotypes, yet little is known about its biological role and regulatory mechanisms. Our research demonstrates that HE4 expression in ovarian cancer can be regulated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. We found that the activation of NF-κB signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a cytokine found in ovarian cancer tumors and ascites, enhanced the secretion of HE4 while its inhibition suppressed HE4 levels. Nuclear translocation of the NF-κB component p65 was found to be critical for HE4 expression; induced NF-κB activation through p65 expression or constitutive IKK2 activity elevated HE4 expression, while p65 knockdown had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we observed that NF-κB mediated HE4 expression at the transcriptional level. Our data also suggests that there is a regulatory role for HE4 in the expression of α5-Integrin, a crucial adhesion molecule in ovarian cancer metastasis; HE4 knockdown corresponded with reduced α5-Integrin expression, cell migration and cell adhesion to fibronectin.\n",

      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study including 2165 cancer patients treated with ICIs between 2013 and 2020. The primary outcome was adverse cardiovascular events (ACE): a composite of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, valvular disease, pericardial disease, and myocarditis. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and the individual components of ACE. We additionally conducted an imaging substudy examining imaging characteristics from echocardiography (echo) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "In our cohort, 44% (n = 962/2165) of patients experienced ACE. In a multivariable analysis, dual ICI therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.45), age (HR 1.01, CI 1.00–1.01), male sex (HR 1.18, CI 1.02–1.36), prior arrhythmia (HR 1.22, CI 1.03–1.43), lung cancer (HR 1.17, CI 1.01–1.37), and central nervous system (CNS) malignancy (HR 1.23, CI 1.02–1.47), were independently associated with increased ACE. ACE was independently associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of mortality (P<0.001). Dual ICI therapy was also associated with a 2.0-fold increased risk of myo/pericarditis (P = 0.045), with myo/pericarditis being associated with a 2.9-fold increased risk of mortality (P<0.001). However, the cardiovascular risks of dual ICI therapy were offset by its mortality benefit, with dual ICI therapy being associated with a ~25% or 1.3-fold decrease in mortality. Of those with echo prior to ICI initiation, 26% (n = 115/442) had abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction or global longitudinal strain, and of those with echo after ICI initiation, 28% (n = 207/740) had abnormalities. Of those who had CMR imaging prior to ICI initiation, 43% (n = 9/21) already had left ventricular dysfunction, 50% (n = 10/20) had right ventricular dysfunction, 32% (n = 6/19) had left ventricular late gadolinium enhancement, and 9% (n = 1/11) had abnormal T2 imaging.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "Dual ICI therapy, prior arrhythmia, older age, lung and CNS malignancies were independently associated with an increased risk of ACE, and dual ICI therapy was also independently associated with an increased risk of myo/pericarditis, highlighting the utmost importance of cardiovascular risk factor optimization in this particularly high-risk population. Fortunately, the occurrence of myo/pericarditis was relatively uncommon, and the overall cardiovascular risks of dual ICI therapy appeared to be offset by a significant mortality benefit. The use of multimodal cardiac imaging can be helpful in stratifying risk and guiding preventative cardiovascular management in patients receiving ICIs.\n",

      "Circulating CD34-positive cell count is inversely associated with height loss. It acts as an indicator of endothelial repair activity. In conjunction with CD34-positive cells, platelets contribute to endothelial repair. The presence of hypertension increases the demand for endothelial repair. Therefore, platelet count could be associated with height loss among individuals with hypertension. A retrospective study of 2,343 individuals aged 40 to 79 years was conducted. Height loss was defined as being in the highest quartile of annual height decrease (1.6 mm/year for men and 2.0 mm/year for women). A significant inverse association between platelet count and height loss was observed only among participants with hypertension. After adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for height loss per 1 standard deviation increment in platelet count (5.09×104/μL for men and 5.03×104/μL for women) was 0.83 (0.70, 0.98) for participants with hypertension and 1.02 (0.90, 1.16) for participants without hypertension. Independent of known cardiovascular risk factors, platelets could prevent accelerated height loss among individuals with hypertension. Unlike CD34-positive cell count, platelet count and blood pressure, which are easy to assess in daily clinical practice, influence height loss.\n",

      "In diabetes mellitus (DM), the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including constipation, diarrhoea, gastroparesis, and/or enteropathy, can be up to ~75%. In this study, we compared three zebrafish larvae models of DM and established an analytical protocol for GI motility. Larvae were fed with either a standard diet (SD; control), or one of three diets to induce a DM-like phenotype: excessive feeding of SD food (ED), a high-fat diet (HFD), or exposing SD-fed larvae to 30 mmol/L glucose (SDG). DM was confirmed using a body-mass index, assessment of adipose deposit areas, two glucose assays, and one insulin assay. An analytical technique, whereby GI motility was quantified using pixel differences to track displacement along the centreline of the anterior, middle, and posterior intestine (AI, MI, and PI, respectively), was developed. Our results indicated that clear DM-like traits were observed in the HFD and SGD models, but not the ED model. In the SD controls, the AI showed similar anterograde and retrograde contractions indicating normal GI mixing; the MI exhibited more prominent forward contractions, and the PI showed distinct rectal waves. Compared to the SD, the HFD and SDG models exhibited significantly increased and decreased contraction velocities and could be used as models of diarrhoea and constipation in DM, respectively, while the ED model showed comparatively little change in motility. Together, these data indicate that complex changes in GI motility are associated with diet and therapeutics used to alleviate GI complications in DM should take these into account. Ultimately, the HFD and SDG models can be used to investigate different aspects of GI motility in association to DM. Hence, zebrafish are a useful model for studying GI dysfunctions due to DM and/or DM medication side-effects.\n",

      "Aspergillus fumigatus is a widely distributed pathogen responsible for severe infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Triazoles are the primary treatments options for Aspergillus infections; however, the emergence of acquired resistance to this antifungal class is becoming a growing concern. In this study, we investigated the potential of the antiviral drug, lopinavir (LPV) to restore the susceptibility of A. fumigatus strains to a set of azoles, while also reducing the required azole dosage for treatment of susceptible isolates. The combination of LPV with either itraconazole (ITC) or posaconazole (POS) demonstrated potent synergistic interactions against 16 out of 23 (~70%) and 21 out of 23 (~91%) A. fumigatus isolates, respectively. Moreover, the combination showed synergistic activity against other clinically important Aspergillus species, including A. niger, A. flavus, and A. brasiliensis. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) for the combinations ranged from 0.18 to 0.313 for ITC and 0.091 to 0.313 for POS, indicating strong synergistic effects. Further investigation revealed that efflux pump inhibition contributed to the synergy observed between azole and LPV. Morphological examination of the fungal cells subjected to this combinational therapy at sub-inhibitory doses showed the presence of carbohydrate granules/patches. The identification of LPV as a promising adjunct therapy holds promise for addressing the emerging challenge of azole resistance in Aspergillus species and improving treatment outcomes for patients.\n",

      "Interpersonal violence is a significant public health and human rights concern. People living with severe mental illness are especially vulnerable. The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda aims to end violence. To this end, we gathered information on the prevalence and factors associated with interpersonal violence among one of the most impacted groups: individuals with severe mental illness at Butabika Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2020, including individuals 18 years or older. Data was collected through a socio-demographics questionnaire and nine questions from the modified My Exposure to Community Violence Questionnaire. The assessment evaluated physical or sexual violence experience, frequency, and perpetrator identity. The data was analyzed using STATA version 12 through simple logistic regression to determine the correlation between a single exposure and the outcome of interest, with a significance level of 5%. Among 385 participants, the past year prevalence of overall reported interpersonal violence was about 34%, while physical and sexual reported interpersonal violence were approximately 29% and 11%, respectively. Participants who had perpetrated physical violence had higher odds of experiencing reported interpersonal violence. With increasing age, the odds of experiencing reported interpersonal violence decreased; compared to those aged 18–24 years, those aged 35–44 years had AOR = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.14–0.70, p = 0.005), and those aged 45 years and above had AOR = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15–0.80, p = 0.013). Reported interpersonal violence was high among the participants. While individuals of older age had lower odds of reporting interpersonal violence, those who had perpetrated physical violence in the past year had higher odds. Screening for interpersonal violence among young patients is recommended. Psycho-education on preventing physical violence should be provided, especially to younger adults. The Ministry of Health should address violence against individuals with mental illness through mass sensitization. A prospective study could investigate risk and protective factors.\n",

      "Having a regular medical doctor is associated with better process of care and health outcomes. The goal of this study was to harness the richness in health administrative data to create a measure which accurately predicted whether patients self-identified as having a regular medical doctor. The Canadian Community Health Survey (2007–2012) was linked with health administrative data (HAD) (2002–2012) from Quebec, Canada’s second largest province. The Canadian Community Health Survey includes respondents’ answer to whether they have a regular medical doctor, but health administrative data does not. We therefore used LASSO and Random Forests to build prediction models that predict whether a patient reports having a regular medical doctor using their data only available in the HAD. Our results show that predicting patient responses to ‘do you have a regular medical doctor?’ using an average of single-year Usual Provider Continuity over 3 years results in an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.782 (0.778–0.787). This was almost a 14% improvement in predictive accuracy compared to the frequently used single-year Usual Provider Continuity (0.688 (0.683–0.694)). We have called this new measure the Reporting a Regular Medical Doctor (RRMD) index. The RRMD index is easy to implement in HAD, is an elegant solution to the difficulties associated with low-users having unstable UPC scores, and brings a patient-oriented perspective to previous efforts to capture patient-physician affiliations in HAD. We recommend that researchers seeking to measure whether patients have a regular medical doctor using HAD consider using the RRMD index.\n",

      "The stochastic rupture risk assessment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) critically depends on sufficient data set size that would allow for the proper distribution estimate. However, in most published cases, the data sets comprise no more than 100 samples, which is deemed insufficient to describe the tails of AAA wall thickness distribution correctly. In this study, we propose a stochastic Bayesian model to merge thickness data from various groups. The thickness data adapted from the literature were supplemented by additional data from 81 patients. The wall thickness was measured at two different contact pressures for 34 cases, which allowed us to estimate the radial stiffness. Herein, the proposed stochastic model is formulated to predict the undeformed wall thickness. Furthermore, the model is able to handle data published solely as summary statistics. After accounting for the different contact pressures, the differences in the medians reported by individual groups decreased by 45%. Combined data can be fitted with a lognormal distribution with parameters μ = 0.85 and σ = 0.32 which can be further used in stochastic analyses.\n",

      "An accelerometer-based device (postural sway-meter) is increasingly used for balance assessment, training, and fall prevention. However, limited information exists regarding its immediate effect on physical and cognitive performance, especially among middle-aged and older adults. This study aims to investigate the immediate effects of a balance training program using a postural sway-meter on balance, functional, and cognitive performance in adults over 50 years. This experimental study involved 72 participants aged 50 years and over, randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group underwent a 30-minute balance training session using the sway-meter with sound feedback (set at 75% of the stability limits at baseline). The control group participated in a 30-minute fall prevention knowledge session. The sway-meter measured balance during quiet stance and leaning. Functional performance was assessed using the multi-dimensional reach test (MDRT). Cognitive performance was evaluated through Trail Making Tests (TMT) A & B, as well as hand/foot reaction time assessments. Between-group comparisons at post-intervention showed no significant differences in balance, functional, and cognitive performance outcomes. Within-group analysis revealed a significant decrease in maximum reaching distance in the forward direction (MDRT) (p = 0.032, d = 0.31, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.78]) and the time to complete TMT-B (p = 0.036, d = 0.24, 95% CI [-0.22, 0.71]) in the intervention group. The control group showed a significant increase in COM angle sway excursion (lateral direction) (p = 0.011, d = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.19, 0.74]) and a decrease in TMT-A time (p = 0.031, d = 0.38, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.85]). Both groups significantly reduced hand reaction time (intervention: p = 0.036, d = 0.24, 95% CI [-0.22, 0.70]; control: p = 0.034, d = 0.20, 95% CI [-0.26, 0.66]) at post-intervention assessment. The findings of this study suggest that a single 30-minute balance training session using a postural sway-meter, delivered by a physiotherapist, is not only feasible and safe for community-dwelling older adults but also has the potential to significantly improve balance and cognitive outcomes. Enhancing the training program by increasing the amount of leaning and duration could further amplify these benefits, underscoring the need for a more robust training regimen.\n",

      "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is most prevalent in young adults, yet scarce evidence is available regarding South Korean young adults’ experience of IPV and culturally tailored IPV prevention programs. To address this gap, this study aimed to holistically assess IPV victimization and perpetration rates and the related risk and protective factors among Korean young adults. Using online survey data from 600 Korean young adults using simple random sampling, this study found that the lifetime prevalence of both IPV victimization and perpetration was about 30%. Both IPV victimization and perpetration had affected over 20% in the past 12 months. Independent variables in multiple logistic regression models explained 18% and 23% of variances in lifetime IPV victimization and perpetration, respectively. Korean young adults who reported more depressive symptoms were more likely to report IPV victimization. Those who reported more alcohol consumption, traditional attitudes about gender roles, being more tolerant of IPV, and poorer physical health status were also more likely to commit IPV. However, those who had experienced family neglect were less likely to report IPV perpetration. The findings of this study highlighted that childhood adverse experiences minimally explained IPV and that alcohol consumption, mental health, and attitudinal variables should be targets of IPV prevention among Korean young adults.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in 2020, has had a tremendous impact on various industries and the daily lives of the general populace, thereby contributing to increasing uncertainty in business competition. Property management enterprises, despite witnessing a mostly stagnant expansion and enhancement of their existing operations, have, owing to the unique nature of their services, continued to experience a relatively positive competitive environment. Notably, the recent emphasis in property management companies has been on the development of value-added services at the community level, which represents a critical avenue for securing a competitive edge by addressing consumer demands. This study, grounded in the ABC theory and the theory of planned behavior, seeks to analyze consumer attitudes towards the provision of value-added services by property management firms, including facets such as community healthcare services, community lifestyle amenities, community educational offerings, and personalized services. Moreover, the study delves into the mediating role played by satisfaction with fundamental property management services. The empirical findings emphasize the significant enhancement in consumer receptivity to property management firms’ value-added services, particularly in the domains of community healthcare, lifestyle amenities, education, and personalized services. In addition, it highlights the indirect effect of property owners’ contentment with essential property management services on their perspectives concerning the delivery of value-added services by property management firms. The implications of these research conclusions bear significant relevance for organizations engaged in offering such services.\n",

The visitor-employed photography technique, supplemented by a questionnaire survey, was used to explore visitors’ preferences for landscape elements and spatial sequences. The landscape elements were identified in eight categories (including vegetation, religious symbol, mountain, route, human, village, temple fair, and facility), and the spatial sequences of photos along the route were divided into containing views at close, middle, and remote distances. Visitors were classified into three types: those motivated by religious purposes, recreational purposes, and multiple purposes. It was concluded that visitors normally preferred the vegetative landscape and religious symbol categories, and they preferred to take photos with views at close distance (with cultural and aesthetic significance) in human settlements. Visitors motivated by different purposes showed different patterns of preferences for landscapes which are in consistent with their travel motivations. This study contributed to an in-depth interpretation of the people-place relationships and the enrichment of tourism motivation theory, and it could provide valuable references for the conservation, management, and planning of religious tourism destinations.\n",

      "Pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug, has been previously shown to ameliorate kidney damage through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we employed an integrative bioinformatics approach to study the possible mechanisms involved in the mitigative effect of pioglitazone against colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. Next, we validated the results obtained from the bioinformatics study by pre-treating human kidney-2 (HK-2) cell line with pioglitazone 100 μM for 30 minutes and then treating the cells with colistin sulfate 1200 μM for 24 hours. Inflammatory signaling by cytokines and the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways were predicted to be involved in the ameliorative effect of pioglitazone against colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. The nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 (NF-κB p65) and Nrf2 were among the predicted transcription factors regulating the hub genes. Moreover, miR-24, miR-16, and miR-21 were identified as potential pathogenic miRNAs regulating the hub genes. In contrast, miR-17, miR-27a, and miR-146a were identified as potential protective miRNAs. The in vitro study indicated that pioglitazone pre-treatment increased cell viability in HK-2 cells exposed to colistin. Pioglitazone pre-treatment reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL6 and TNF). Moreover, pioglitazone reduced the protein expression of NF-κB p65 and increased the protein expression of Nrf2. The protective effect of pioglitazone against colistin-induced toxicity in HK-2 cells is related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity through modulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling and Nrf2-mediated antioxidative stress signaling.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effect of PBL on problem-solving, self-directed learning, and critical thinking ability of pharmaceutical students through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and meta-analysis of RCTs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "In 2021, 57 third-year pharmacy students from China Pharmaceutical University were randomly divided into a PBL group and a lecture-based learning (LBL) group. Mean scores were compared between the two groups for problem-solving, self-directed learning, communication skills, critical thinking, and final exam grades. Students’ feedback on the implementation of PBL was also collected. A meta-analysis was subsequently performed. Two authors independently conducted a comprehensive search of two databases (PubMed and CNKI). Eligible studies with effective data were included and the valuable data were extracted for analysis. Quality of involved studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. All analyses of statistics were conducted using the ‘metafor’ package in R software.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The PBL group had significantly higher mean scores for problem-solving (8.43±1.56) and self-directed learning (7.39±1.19) than the LBL group (7.02±1.72 and 6.41±1.28, respectively). The PBL group also showed better communication skills (8.86±1.47) than the LBL group (7.68±1.89). The mean level of critical thinking was significantly higher in the PBL group than the LBL group (p = 0.02). The PBL group also had better final exam grades (79.86±1.38) compared to the LBL group (68.1±1.76). Student feedback on PBL implementation was positive. The outcome of subsequent meta-analysis including 8 eligible studies involved 1819 participants showed that the use of PBL significantly improved problem-solving ability (SMD = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.25–1.99) and PBL was also associated with better performance in self-directed learning (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.64–2.45). However, there was no significant difference in the final exam score in the PBL group compared to the LBL control group (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI = -0.08–0.53).\n",

      "We observed multiple gray bats (Myotis grisescens) in 2022 with large patches of fur loss (i.e., alopecia) on the dorsal surface of their body. Alopecia in wildlife has been linked to multiple possible factors and often is a sign of suboptimal health. In 2023, we designed an experiment to compare prevalence of alopecia in gray bats across various reproductive stages, characterize the severity of alopecia lesions, and determine the ectoparasites and microbiota present on the regions of fur loss. We harp-trapped four summer gray bat roosts 2–3 times between 11 April–30 August 2023 and collected skin swabs and scrapes from each bat with alopecia. We determined the severity of the alopecia lesions on a scale 0–7 by summing the degree of redness (0–2), skin condition (0–1), and percentage of fur loss (0–4). We cultured the skin swabs for fungal and bacterial growth and examined skin scrapes under a microscope to determine the presence of subcutaneous mites. We found no evidence that subcutaneous mites cause the fur loss. We determined that prevalence of alopecia in M. grisescens varies throughout the summer. Prevalence is highest for female bats that are or recently were lactating, reaching an average of 6% ± 6 SD (0–15% range) of captured females exhibiting fur loss during the pup rearing period. Alopecia is most prevalent in male bats in early summer (1% ± 2 SD; 0–4% range). Lactating females had more severe cases than males and were often associated with skin redness due to unknown causes. Bats with alopecia did not differ in body condition, determined from body mass, from bats without alopecia. Future studies could investigate the role of stress in possible autoimmune responses contributing to alopecia. Conservation strategies aimed at reducing stress and supporting nutritional requirements during the summer are likely beneficial to M. grisescens.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms, transmitted via mosquito bites. Significant global efforts have led to the interruption of LF transmission, with eight of the 16 previously endemic Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) validated by WHO as having eliminated the disease as a public health problem. Post-validation surveillance (PVS) is recommended to verify the absence of a resurgence in transmission; however, there are no guidelines on how to implement such surveillance effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aim\n",
      "This protocol outlines a research study that aims to explore, synthesise, and prioritise the perspectives of LF program staff from LF-eliminated PICTs. The study will focus on identifying the challenges faced in implementing PVS in the PICT settings and determining corresponding context-relevant operational research priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method\n",
      "The study will employ a nominal group technique (NGT) involving representatives from LF-eliminated PICTs. The NGT will adhere to a structured process for generating, ranking, and prioritising ideas, followed by group discussions, debates, and the collation of shared views.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "The research will provide insights into the most significant challenges faced in implementing PVS in the PICTs. It will also identify priority areas where operational research is required to inform policy and practice. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a rigorous consensus group method to distil challenges and research priorities for LF PVS in PICTs. We expect that this research will inform the development of national and regional LF guidelines.\n",

      "Background and objectives\n",
      "End-of-life care supports individuals in the last few weeks or months of their life and their caregivers, offering psychosocial support, symptom management and relief, and resources. While some of the first public end-of-life care facilities were established due to HIV/AIDS, the current needs of caregivers for people living with end-stage HIV are not well understood. Caregivers provide two-thirds of the care for people living with HIV, yet their specific support needs and experiences are under-researched. Existing strategies often use a “one-size-fits-all” approach, which may not address the unique challenges faced by these caregivers, such as stigma and lack of social support. This study aims to synthesize the literature on the end-of-life care experiences and needs of caregivers for individuals living with HIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Research design and methods\n",
      "A scoping review, guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework and the Joanna Briggs Institute’s recommendations, will be conducted. An Information Specialist will assist in developing a search strategy to be applied across databases like Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Search results from each database will be imported into Covidence software for duplicate removal and title and abstract screening. Two researchers will independently screen studies using the ‘Population–Concept–Context’ (PCC) framework, with screening conducted at two levels: title and abstract, and full-text. The inclusion criteria will be piloted on a random sample of articles to ensure inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic >0.61). Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or with the involvement of a content expert if needed. Final selections will be reported using the PRISMA flow diagram, and reasons for exclusion will be documented.\n",

      "\n",
      "Discussion and implications\n",
      "The findings from this scoping review will provide valuable insights into the end-of-life care experiences and support needs of caregivers for individuals living with HIV. By identifying common themes and challenges, such as caregiver fatigue, emotional strain, stigma, and lack of social support, this study will underscore the inadequacy of the current “one-size-fits-all” approach in addressing the unique needs of these caregivers. This research has the potential to influence both clinical practice and policy by advocating for more personalized support strategies within end-of-life care settings.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Female sex workers (FSWs) are marginalized groups of the population who have limited access to healthcare and a higher risk of HIV infection due to biobehavioral and structural risk factors. Although it is known that the Eastern and Southern African region is affected by the highest HIV incidence and prevalence, understanding the burden among FSWs in the region remains limited. We aimed to assess the pooled prevalence and associated factors of HIV in this vulnerable population.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Hinari, African Journals Online (AJOL), Google, and Google Scholar. The searching mechanism was constructed using keywords identified by CoCoPop (Condition, Context, and Population) framework and medical subject heading terms to recruit studies published between January 1, 2015 and March 30, 2024. Observational studies that estimate the prevalence or incidence or associated factors of HIV among FSWs, even if FSWs were not the main focus of the study, were included. The quality of included studies was assessed using Joana Brigg’s Institute checklist. Data were extracted and analyzed using STATA 17 software. To estimate the pooled effect sizes with their 95% confidence intervals, a random effect model was fitted. The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity. Funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were utilized to assess the small study effect. Publication bias was managed using trim-and-fill analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were considered to handle heterogeneity among studies.\n",

      "Results\n",
      "A total of 54 articles with 78,747 FSWs who had successful HIV biological test were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of HIV among FSWs in Eastern and Southern Africa was 36.0% (95% CI: 31.0%–41.0%). Regionally, the pooled prevalence was 59.0% (95% CI: 53.0%–64.0%) and 29.0% (95% CI: 25.0%–34.0%) in Southern and Eastern Africa, respectively. Age above 35 (POR = 7.35; 95% CI: 5.26, 10.28) and 25–34 years (POR = 2.91; 95% CI: 2.02, 4.21), being married (POR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.66), divorced (POR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.39, 2.13), and widowed (POR = 2.70; 95% CI: 2.09, 3.49), primary education (POR = 1.29; 95% CI:1.08, 1.55), history of sexually transmitted infection (POR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.90), syphilis (POR = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.98), Hepatitis B infection (POR = 2.60; 95% CI: 1.07,6.32), drinking alcohol (POR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.45) and injectable drug use before sex (POR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.47) were found significantly associated with the increased risk of HIV infection among FSWs.\n",

      "These data suggest an urgent need to improve access to HIV prevention programs for FSWs. Providing behavioral interventions including reduction of alcohol and injectable drug use before sex, initiating tailored healthcare services, strengthening the psychosocial and legal support network, and fostering partnership might reduce the burden in the region.

      "Ensuring the sustainability of seafood is increasingly important for supporting food security and stable livelihoods in the face of a growing human population. A country’s seafood sustainability is often defined by how it manages its fisheries stocks; however, growth in the volume and complexity of global seafood trade has created an increasing disconnect between the sustainability of a country’s seafood production and their seafood consumption. Using a global seafood trade database, we demonstrate wide differences between country-specific sustainability of produced versus consumed seafood. Our findings suggest that countries most consistently considered leaders in seafood production sustainability will inevitably consume seafood held to lower sustainability standards through their participation in the global seafood trade network. This issue is exacerbated by an inability to accurately trace the origins of seafood products based on current international trade reporting practices. Our analysis suggests that improved international seafood tracing and sustainability metrics that account for both production and consumption are critical to future efforts to manage global seafood sustainability.\n",

      "Among older adults in Japan, those requiring long-term care who use visiting nursing services have particularly poor oral health. Given the importance of oral health, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of oral health improvement interventions for such older adult patients using visiting nursing services. This study was a single-arm pilot study. The participants were those who provide oral care to older adults who use visiting nursing services, whether the patients themselves or their family members. Participants implemented oral care appropriate to the patient’s oral environment at least once a day for four weeks. Feasibility assessment consisted of the recruitment, completion, and compliance rates. Changes in the oral environment were measured using the Oral Health Assessment Tool-Japanese (OHAT-J), and changes in scores were assessed over the study period. The study was conducted across three visiting nursing stations, with 52 participants (a recruitment rate of 73.2%). Of these, 42 participants completed the final questionnaire (a completion rate of 80.8%). The compliance rate was 64.3%. The mean OHAT-J score was 4.5 (SD 2.3) pre-intervention, 3.7 (SD 2.0) at one week post-intervention, and 3.6 (SD 2.2) at four weeks post-intervention (p < 0.001), indicating a significant positive trend. The feasibility of this intervention was generally satisfactory, and the results showed that the oral environment was improved. Future studies with a larger scale and higher level of evidence should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.\n",

      "Rehabilitation from musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) complicate healing dynamics typically by sustained disuse of bone and muscles. Microgravity naturally allows limb disuse and thus an effective model to understand MSKI. The current study examined epigenetic changes in a segmental bone defect (SBD) mouse model in a prolonged unloading condition after spaceflight (FLT). We further connected potential miRNA–mRNA regulatory pathways impacting bone healing. Here, SBD surgery was performed on nine-week-old male mice that were launched into space for approximately 4 weeks. Sham with no surgery and ground controls were included in the study. The midshaft of the ipsilateral femur (with callus on the surgical mice) as well as the ipsilateral quadriceps tissue were used for analysis. Femur and quadriceps had a distinct miRNA profile. There was a stronger surgery effect as observed by miRNA expression when compared to microgravity effects. Leukopoiesis, granulopoiesis, myelopoiesis of leukocytes, differentiation of myeloid leukocytes, and differentiation of progenitor cells were all altered because of surgery in the femur. The biological functions such as apoptosis, necrosis, and activation of cell migration and viability were altered because of surgery in quadriceps. Integrating the transcriptome and microRNA data indicated pronounced changes because of microgravity. According to pathway analysis, microgravity had a greater impact on the quadriceps tissue than the bone tissue in the absence of surgery. The altered biological functions resulting from microgravity were validated by integrating limited proteomics data to miRNA-mRNA. Thus, this study highlights the importance of dynamic interplay of gene-epigene regulations as they appear to be intrinsically interconnected and influence in combination for the biological outcome.\n",
