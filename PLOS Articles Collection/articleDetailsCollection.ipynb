      "Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) result from excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the lung, causing irreversible damage to the lung architecture. Clinical management of ILDs differs depending on the diagnosis, but differentiation between subtypes can be difficult and better clinical biomarkers are needed. In this study, we use a 166-gene NanoString assay to investigate whether there are ILD subtype-specific transcripts in whole blood. We identified one transcript, killer cell lectin like receptor 1 (KLRF1), as differentially expressed between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD), and identified two transcripts (VCAN, LTK) associated with IPF expression against other ILD subtypes. These findings were validated by examining their expression in ILD lung, with KLRF1 expression significantly higher in SSc-ILD compared to IPF and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) samples. Taken together, this pilot study provides support for the use of the peripheral transcriptome in identifying diagnostic biomarkers of ILD with biological relevance.\n",

      "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are crucial for protecting human skin from infection. Therefore, the expression levels of beneficial AMPs such as ribonuclease 7 (RNase 7) must be appropriately regulated in healthy human skin. However, there is limited understanding regarding the regulating AMP expression, especially when using applications directly to healthy human skin. Here, we investigated the effects of the extract of Ruscus aculeatus (RAE), a medicinal plant native to Mediterranean Europe and Africa that is known to have a high safety level, on AMP expression in primary human keratinocytes. Treatment with RAE induced RNase 7 expression, which was suppressed by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. The autophagic flux assay and the immunofluorescence analysis of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-Ⅱ and p62 showed that RAE inhibited late-phase autophagy. Moreover, both the inhibition of early-phase autophagy by EX-527, an inhibitor of silent information regulator of transcription 1 (SIRT1) and its enhancement by resveratrol, an activator of SIRT1 inhibited RNase 7 and ERK expression, indicating that autophagosome accumulation is necessary for RAE-induced RNase 7 expression. Additionally, spilacleoside was identified as the active component in RAE. These findings suggest that RAE promotes RNase 7 expression via ERK activation following inhibition of late-phase autophagy in primary human keratinocytes and that this mechanism is a novel method of regulation of AMP expression.\n",

      "Climate warming can precipitate mismatches in plant-pollinator interactions by altering their phenologies of both parties, impacting ecosystem services. While most studies have focused on long-term, seasonal phenological shifts, the effect of warming on short-term phenological match-mismatch in these interactions remains unclear. Here, we investigate how experimental warming affects within-day foraging behavior of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and plant anthesis, and whether the resulting changes in bee pollen composition, in terms of the relative abundance of pollen from different plant species, influences larval development. Experimental warming advanced both the within-day foraging by bees and anthesis of Bidens pilosa—the predominant pollen source among all plant species represented in the collected pollen. Through experimental manipulation of pollen composition, we demonstrated that an increased proportion of B. pilosa pollen in the diet enhanced bee larval growth efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates that warming may influence pollinator interactions with the many plant species by affecting pollinator behaviors and plant anthesis on short-term temporal scales, with potential implications for pollinator larval development.\n",

International databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Science Direct, African Journal Online, Directory of Open Access Journal, and African Index Medicus) and Ethiopian university repositories (Jimma, Addis Ababa, Haramaya, Hawassa, and Gondar Universities) were searched from September 4–15, 2023, to identify articles published on the topic. The pooled prevalence of hyperemesis gravidarum with a 95% confidence interval was presented using the forest plots. The heterogeneity of the studies was checked by I2 with its corresponding p-values and the Galbraith plot. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity.

      "Cervical cancer has been identified as the fourth most common form of malignancy affecting and killing women globally. Nurses caring for cervical cancer patients are exposed to emotional and psychological distress due to late presentation and the burden of care. Resilience has been identified as one of the effective ways of helping nurses to cope well with the stress of oncology nursing, but this remains undetermined in Ghana\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aim\n",
      "This study explored personal and workplace factors influencing the resilience of nurses caring for women diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer (stage III and IV) in a resource-constrained setting in Ghana\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method\n",
      "Using a qualitative approach, we recruited twenty nurses and midwives who had worked for a year and above caring for advanced-stage cervical cancer patients at the national referral hospital in Ghana. We conducted in-depth interviews between July, 2022 to September, 2022 which were audio-taped with participants’ consent. Transcription was done verbatim, and analysis conducted using thematic analysis approach with the aid of NVivo 10.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The results revealed experience as a safety toolkit, inherent desire to help/care for the patient, emotional numbness and maintaining professional outlook as personal factors influencing resilience among the participants. Regarding the workplace factors influencing resilience, we identified the main theme of demands of caregiving for advanced cervical cancer patients with the following sub-themes; severity of cases managed, nature of care rendered, activities of care given, reshuffling, schedules and gender mirroring as an exacerbator of psychological suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Resilience among nurses and midwives caring for terminally ill cervical cancer patients is influenced by longer years of service, intrinsic motivation to work as a nurse, and the defense strategy of emotional numbness and professionalism at the individual level. Also, the huge demand of caregiving serves as a major workplace factor affecting the resilience of nurses and midwives. We recommend strategies such as regular ward conferences and in-service trainings aimed at enhancing job-experience, inherent desire to render care and professionalism be adopted in resource-constrained settings to improve nurses’ resilience. In addition, political actors and management of hospitals must prioritize allocation of resources for advanced cervical cancer care with particular focus on providing more specialized nurses and midwives.\n",

      "To eliminate vertical transmission of HIV, global institutions recommend using a risk-guided approach for HIV prevention services in antenatal and postnatal settings.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis to identify common predictors of maternal HIV acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We searched four databases for full-text articles that estimated associations between at least one predictor and risk of HIV acquisition among pregnant and/or lactating women (PLW) in SSA. We restricted our synthesis to predictors assessed in at least four study populations. For these predictors, we summarized how each predictor was defined and used vote counting and descriptive statistics to characterize overall trends.\n",

      "Results\n",

Studies were implemented in 12 countries between 1988 and 2021 and enrolled a total of 164,480 PLW at risk of acquiring HIV. Of the 66 predictors evaluated, 16 met our inclusion criteria. Estimated associations tended to be imprecise and variability in how predictors were measured precluded meta-analyses. We observed trends towards a higher risk of maternal HIV acquisition among young women and women who reported early coital debut, multiple partnerships, sexually transmitted infections, being unaware of partner HIV status, or having a partner living with HIV. In most studies, PLW in stable, monogamous relationships experienced a lower risk of acquiring HIV than those who were single, separated, or in a polygynous marriage. HIV risk perception, condom use, and vaginal drying were also commonly associated with HIV acquisition risk.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",

      "Cerebral blood flow at rest declines with age. However, age-related changes in functional measures of cerebrovascular health including cerebrovascular reactivity and neurovascular coupling are not well understood. Additionally, the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular function remains unclear. APOEε4 positive (APOEε4+; n = 37, age = 63±4y) and APOEε4 negative (APOEε4-; n = 50, age = 63±4y) cognitively unimpaired adults participated in this study. Macrovascular cerebral blood flow and microvascular cerebral perfusion were measured using 4D flow MRI and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI, respectively. Cerebrovascular reactivity and neurovascular coupling were assessed by measuring middle cerebral artery blood velocity in response to hypercapnia and the n-back test, respectively. Neurovascular coupling was lower in APOEε4+ compared with APOEε4- adults (P<0.05), despite higher cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia. Alterations in neurovascular coupling may occur early, prior to changes in cognition, in aging APOEε4 carriers.\n",

      "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the risk and predictive factors of splenic malignancy and hemangiosarcoma in dogs undergoing splenectomy at a surgical specialty clinic. Medical records, hematologic results, surgical reports, and histopathologic results from 182 dogs that underwent splenectomy for the treatment of splenic masses or nodules were reviewed retrospectively. The majority of dogs (57.7%) had benign splenic diagnoses with no malignancy. Hemangiosarcoma was diagnosed in 32.4% of the dogs. A final multivariable model indicated that thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a smaller diameter of the largest splenic nodule were risk factors for hemangiosarcoma (P<0.001), and hemoperitoneum (P = 0.01) was an additional risk factor when nodule diameter was not evaluated. There were 91 dogs that had hemoperitoneum, and 60.4% of those dogs had malignant splenic lesions. Of the 33 dogs that underwent a splenectomy for incidentally identified splenic lesions, 93.9% had benign splenic lesions. Breed size was not a significant predictor of splenic malignancy risk; however, all 6 of the German shepherds included in the study had a hemangiosarcoma diagnosis. Overall prevalence of splenic malignancy including HSA may be overestimated in some canine populations.\n",

The inadequate social support from family/relatives, neighbours, community and national policies such as maternity leave, alongside the absence of NGOs/INGOs support, put women at risk of poor mental health. In addition to the inadequate support, limited availability and accessibility of maternal health services potentially cause immense distress among pregnant women. Furthermore, in the context of a patriarchal society, the impact of socioeconomic and cultural context on pregnant women’s mental health is also presented as a major determinant of poor mental health among pregnant women.\n",

Healthcare providers in this study mainly used the overview page of the visual decision aids. Although this is valued by both providers and patients, it is also important to discuss the individual treatment pages, including the pros and cons, with patients. This study also points to differences between outpatient clinics or departments in the use and implementation of the visual decision aids.

      "This study identified and analyzed metaphors related to the lived experience of young-onset dementia that were used in nine illness narratives written by people with the condition. A final set of 1111 MEs sorted into 30 source domain categories were grouped according to six target domain categories reflecting the biologic (the person with dementia’s body/brain), psychologic (suffering with dementia, coping with dementia, dementia itself, the person with dementia), and social (the social experience of dementia) aspects of having dementia. Notably, many of the metaphors were similar to previously reported metaphors of illness, such as fight and journey, and other metaphors of embodiment, as well as disease as enemy, body as container, and body as machine. In addition, although negative conceptualizations were in the majority, almost one-third of the metaphoric expressions, belonging to the fight and journey source domain categories, reflected mainly positive images. The commonality of metaphor types with those of other illness experiences supports the notion of shared metaphors across illness contexts. Moreover, in contrast to the dehumanizing and stigmatizing terms that have previously been used to socially construct dementia, the positivity of metaphoric images identified here indicates the authors’ proactive and affirming conceptualizations of their experience of dementia. Health care professionals can draw on this study’s findings to help their own patients make sense of and cope with dementia.\n",

      "Radiomics offers a novel strategy for the differential diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and prediction of treatment responses in breast cancer. Studies have explored radiomic signatures from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM), but the diagnostic accuracy varies widely. To evaluate this performance, we conducted a meta-analysis performing a comprehensive literature search across databases including PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) until March 31, 2024. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Twenty-four eligible studies encompassing 5588 breast cancer patients were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77–0.84), specificity of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.81–0.87), PLR of 5.24 (95%CI: 4.32–6.34), NLR of 0.23 (95%CI: 0.19–0.27), DOR of 23.16 (95%CI: 17.20–31.19), and AUC of 0.90 (95%CI: 0.87–0.92), indicating good diagnostic performance. Significant heterogeneity was observed in analyses of sensitivity (I2 = 74.64%) and specificity (I2 = 83.18%). Spearman’s correlation coefficient suggested no significant threshold effect (P = 0.538). Meta-regression and subgroup analyses identified several potential heterogeneity sources, including data source, integration of clinical factors and peritumor features, MRI equipment, magnetic field strength, lesion segmentation, and modeling methods. In conclusion, DCE-MRI radiomic models exhibit good diagnostic performance in predicting ALNM and SLNM in breast cancer. This non-invasive and effective tool holds potential for the preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients.\n",

      "The common house mosquito Culex pipiens s.l., widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and North America has two recognized biotypes, Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and Cx. pipiens biotype molestus, which hybridize. Despite their morphological similarities, these biotypes may exhibit ecological differences. This complex ecological mosaic may affect the interaction of Cx. pipiens with pathogens like avian Plasmodium, which is transmitted to wildlife. Although the vector competence for Cx. pipiens biotype molestus has been well studied, there is a lack of studies comparing the vector competence of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and their hybrids for the transmission of avian Plasmodium. Here, we evaluated the vector competence of the Cx. pipiens biotypes pipiens, molestus and their hybrids for the transmission of two avian Plasmodium species. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on blood of wild infected birds and the presence of DNA of Plasmodium in head-thorax and saliva of mosquitoes was molecularly evaluated at 13 day-post exposure. The transmission rates (i.e., the detection of parasite DNA in mosquito saliva) for Plasmodium cathemerium were similar for the two biotypes of Cx. pipiens and their hybrids while Plasmodium relictum DNA was only found in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. In addition, P. cathemerium was significantly more prevalent than P. relictum in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. Our results suggest that avian Plasmodium is transmitted by both Cx. pipiens biotypes and their hybrids although differences could be found depending of the parasite species studied. Differences in the abundance of each biotype and their hybrids within areas characterized by distinct environmental conditions, along with variations in their blood-feeding patterns and the parasites infecting birds, could ultimately determine differences in the relevance of each Cx. pipiens biotype in the transmission of avian Plasmodium.\n",

      "Singapore has seen an increase in norovirus outbreaks in preschools from 2019 to 2022 primarily due to person-to-person transmission. This study describes the use of compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) modelling to simulate the spread of norovirus among preschool children in a classroom setting. Different intervention measures, such as isolation of infected preschoolers, handwashing and surface decontamination were modelled to quantify their effectiveness at reducing the number of children infected. We found that isolation of the sick child was the most effective single intervention to reduce transmission risk, which was 5 times more effective than handwashing. Coupled with handwashing and surface decontamination, transmission risk could be further reduced, close to zero. Findings from our study can be used to reiterate to parents and teachers on the importance of recognizing the symptoms exhibited by their unwell children and refraining from sending them to school, as this action poses a risk of transmitting norovirus to other children. In addition, our findings can be used to educate children and staff in preschools on the importance of practising good personal hygiene and regular environmental cleaning. Through this study, decision makers would be better informed on the effectivness of various risk mitigation measures at reduce the risk of norovirus transmission in preschool settings.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Currently, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging of choice for the differential diagnosis of various cystic lung lesions, including true cystic lung diseases (CLD) and lesions that may mimic them. However, the traditionally used inspiratory scan still presents a significant spectrum of overlapping radiological features. Recent studies have demonstrated variation in lesion size between inspiratory and expiratory phases, probably due to cyst-airway communication. In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review of paired inspiratory and expiratory HRCT in the assessment of cystic lesions as an additional tool to narrow the differential diagnosis.\n",

      "Methods\n",
      "A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, BVS, and Cochrane through August 2023. Full-text articles that performed paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans in adult patients with cystic lung lesions were included, with the outcome measured as the reduction in lesion size according to the respiratory phase. Diagnoses were confirmed through histopathological or radiological features.\n",

Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (PLCH), Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) honeycombing and cystic bronchiectasis became considerably smaller during expiratory CT scans, while the size of emphysema tended to remain constant during respiratory cycles.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "This study has suggested that paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans can be valuable for helping differentiate between emphysema and other diseases with a cystic pattern due to their ability to reveal dynamic properties of the lesions. However, the average reduction in cyst size as a single parameter is not sufficient for further refining diagnostics. Studies exploring advanced metrics to assess the reduction in lesion diameter emerge as potential opportunities to investigate the cyst-airway communication hypothesis and further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of paired methods.\n",

      "The removal of subgingival deposits, especially calculus, plays a crucial role in basic periodontal therapy. However, manual detection methods affect accuracy owing to the operator’s skill. To avoid this uncertainty, we have developed a calculus detection device named “Sensor probe” and evaluated its ability to detect calculus for future clinical applications. The Sensor probe consisted of a 635 nm-wavelength semiconductor laser and a 0.5 mm-diameter single-mode optical fiber. Initially, the performance of the device was evaluated using clinically obtained extracted teeth with calculus covered with a stainless-steel shielding plate with pinhole. Then, the effect of the optical fiber’s end shape on calculus detection performance was analyzed. Lastly, the performance of the Sensor probe was compared to that of a conventional periodontal probe in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for calculus detection using calculus-covered extracted teeth. The results indicated that Sensor probe detected dental calculus through the pinhole with a diameter of 300 μm or more when applied from a distance of 100 μm. The results analyzing the effect of the optical fiber’s end shape on calculus detection performance showed that cutting the fiber end at an angle of 45° resulted in the most effective calculus detection. This may be because the laser light refracted on the cut surface and concentrated on the fiber side. Moreover, by comparing the performance of this device to a conventional periodontal probe revealed that the Sensor probe showed improved calculus detection accuracy in deeper periodontal pockets. This improvement was particularly significant in the apical third, where detection is typically difficult. In conclusion, a Sensor probe that uses an optical fiber with a 45° angled end may facilitate subgingival calculus detection. In future clinical applications, Sensor probes could lead to more accurate and efficient calculus removal, especially for deeper periodontal pockets.\n",

      "Sibling sexual behaviour, despite historical and cross-cultural incest taboos and biologically driven incest avoidance, poses a persistent problem. We tested factors theorized to be associated with sibling incest in a cross-sectional online survey of 1,863 respondents with siblings mainly from North America and Germany. We found that 13% of participants reported engaging in sexual contact with a sibling, typically starting at the age of 10, and that step-siblings and half-siblings were more likely to engage in sibling incest than full siblings. Curiosity and games were the primary motivators; being coerced was more prevalent among female and younger participants. The study underscores both individual (e.g., impulsivity, concurrent childhood sexual behaviour problems) and family level factors (e.g., presence of step-sibling, positive attitudes toward nudity, sexual abuse by parent) influencing liability to engage in sexual behaviours with a sibling. Findings were robust across English- and German-speaking participants, suggesting our results are generalizable. Professionals addressing problematic child sexual behaviour should assess for concurrent sibling incest, and evaluate positive family attitudes towards nudity, sexual abuse by parents, and reduced disgust to sibling incest as potential risk factors for sibling incest. The findings stress the need for comprehensive sexual education in blended households, where age gaps and diminished genetic relatedness contribute to sibling sexual behaviour.\n",

      "Evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination of animals against rabies is not routinely implemented. In cases where it is carried out, the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) or the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test are the recommended tests. However, both of these tests require handling of live rabies virus (RABV), and are cumbersome to perform. In view of this, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been proposed as a surrogate test; however, availability of appropriate antigen is a major impediment for the development of ELISAs to detect anti-rabies antibodies. The most widely used antigen is the RABV glycoprotein (G) purified from cell culture-propagated virus, which requires a biosafety level 3 containment. The alternative is to use recombinantly expressed G, which needs to be to be properly glycosylated and folded to serve as the best antigen. The most suitable system for its production is the baculovirus expression system (BVES). However, purification of RABV G is challenging. We therefore tested partially purified preparations in the form of extracts of insect cells infected with baculovirus expressing RABV G, against sera from vaccinated dogs in an indirect ELISA. The results showed good concordance against RFFIT, with sensitivity and specificity of 90.48% and 80.00%, respectively. The system may be used for quick screening to determine the presence and an approximate level of antibodies, and can be modified to enable monitoring of mass dog vaccination programs, as well as to facilitate certification of dogs intended for international travel and transportation.\n",

      "It is important to establish the relationship between appropriate nutritional intake and improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) in elderly hospitalized patients. This prospective observational study aimed to investigate diet order compliance (DOC) during 8 weeks of hospitalization and calculate the odds of improved functional independence measure (FIM) scores for high- and low-DOC groups using covariate-adjusted models in geriatric convalescent hospitals. The study subjects were elderly inpatients (>65 years old) with degenerative disease who consumed prescribed oral meals (Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) = 6/7) and who did not receive physical/occupational therapy. The personalized diet order was prescript, and the DOC was calculated using dietitian-monitored daily intake data. The 73 patients were divided into a low-DOC group (< 84.0%, n = 35) and a high-DOC group (≥ 84.0%, n = 38) on the basis of the median DOC (84.0%, average for 8 weeks). Twenty (52.6%) high-DOC patients and nine (25.7%) low-DOC patients experienced motor-FIM improvements (P = 0.017). After 8 weeks, the change in motor-FIM in the high-DOC group (1.6±0.3) was greater than that in the low-DOC group (0.3±0.1; P = 0.001). According to the baseline and nutrition-intake-adjusted model of multiple logistic regression analysis, in the high-DOC group, the motor-FIM improvement OR was 5.102 (95% CI: 1.100–16.233, P = 0.036), and the total-FIM improvement OR was 5.273 (95% CI: 1.102–25.238, P = 0.037). High compliance with individualized nutritional prescriptions can increase FIM scores in clinical settings. Thus, comprehensive approaches to increase dietary compliance are needed for elderly long-term care patients.\n",

On CEUS with CVI, complex intratumoral and peripheral vessels were frequent in HCCs (100% of HCCs, 46.2% of non-HCC malignancies, and 70.0% of benign tumors), while detour vessels were frequent in non-HCC malignancies (none of HCCs, 53.8% of non-HCC malignancies, and 10.0% of benign tumors) (p<0.001). The mean velocity of HCC (26.3 mm/s) was the highest, while that of non-HCC malignancy (20.6 mm/s) was the lowest (p<0.001).

      "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants presents challenges to vaccine effectiveness, underlining the necessity for next-generation vaccines with multiple antigens beyond the spike protein. Here, we investigated a multiantigenic booster containing spike and a chimeric construct composed of nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) proteins, comparing its efficacy to a spike-only booster against Omicron BA.5 in K18-hACE2 mice. Initially, mice were primed and boosted with Beta (B.1.351) spike-only mRNA, showing strong spike-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies, albeit with limited cross-neutralization to Omicron variants. Subsequently, a spike-NM multiantigenic vaccine was then examined as a second booster dose for protection in hACE2-transgenic mice. Mice receiving either homologous spike-only or heterologous spike-NM booster had nearly complete inhibition of infectious virus shedding in oral swabs and reduced viral burdens in both lung and nasal tissues following BA.5 challenge. Examination of lung pathology further revealed that both spike-only and spike-NM boosters provided comparable protection against inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis. Moreover, the spike-NM booster demonstrated neutralization efficacy in a pseudovirus assay against Wuhan-Hu-1, Beta, and Omicron variants akin to the spike-only booster. These findings indicate that supplementing spike with additional SARS-CoV-2 targets in a booster immunization confers equivalent immunity and protection against Omicron BA.5. This work highlights a promising strategy for individuals previously vaccinated with spike-only vaccines, potentially offering enhanced protection against emerging coronaviruses.\n",

      "Cancer cells are known to express the Warburg effect—increased glycolysis and formation of lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen—as well as high glutamine uptake. In tumors, cancer cells are surrounded by collagen, immune cells, and neoangiogenesis. Whether collagen formation, neoangiogenesis, and inflammation in cancer are associated with the Warburg effect needs to be established. Metabolic modelling has proven to be a tool of choice to understand biological reality better and make in silico predictions. Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs) are essential for conducting an unbiased decomposition of a metabolic model into its minimal functional units. EFMs can be investigated using our tool, aspefm, an innovative approach based on logic programming where biological constraints can be incorporated. These constraints allow networks to be characterized regardless of their size. Using a metabolic model of the human cell containing collagen, neoangiogenesis, and inflammation markers, we derived a subset of EFMs of biological relevance to the Warburg effect. Within this model, EFMs analysis provided more adequate results than parsimonious flux balance analysis and flux sampling. Upon further inspection, the EFM with the best linear regression fit to cancer cell lines exometabolomics data was selected. The minimal pathway, presenting the Warburg effect, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and release of inflammation markers, showed that collagen production was possible directly de novo from glutamine uptake and without extracellular import of glycine and proline, collagen’s main constituents.\n",

      "To use phages in a personalized therapy and industrial applications, an accurate quantification is needed. The gold standard method, namely the culture-based double agar overlay (DAO) method, provides an accurate estimate of the number of infectious phages but is laborious and time-intensive. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) can be used as a fast alternative but tends to overestimate the number of infectious phage particles. Here we describe the use of a DNase treatment before quantification of the Staphylococcus aureus phage ISP with qPCR to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of infectious phage particles. We showed that DNase treatment results in a significant decrease of the concentration when measured with qPCR although for two out of three tested ISP phage stocks, there was still a significant difference with the DAO method. We also showed that the discrepancy between quantification with qPCR and the DAO method is dependent on the storage period of the phage stock, with a larger discrepancy for older stocks. Additionally, we used negative contrast immune electron microscopy to confirm the presence of DNA in the medium of the phage stock and the impact of the DNase treatment on the free DNA.\n",

Qualitatively, Medenes and Begait, cattle breeds from lowland agroecology and livestock-based production systems, possess a convex facial profile, relatively larger dewlap, naval flap, and perpetual sheath, as well as more uniform and lighter body colors than the Adwa and Arado cattle breeds, which are from the midland agroecology and mixed crop–livestock production systems. Morphometrically, clear differences were observed among all of the studied cattle breeds, where the Begait, Medenes, Arado, and Adwa cattle breeds were ordered in descending order according to their overall body size. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed significant differences among the breeds where each breed was placed under a separate group. However, such phenotypic distinctions among the four cattle breeds do not necessarily indicate genetic dissimilarities. Therefore, further inclusive genetic characterization studies involving the use of representative samples from the Adwa and Medenes cattle breeds are recommended to quantify the degree of genetic relationships among these breeds. Moreover, owing to the unknown breed-level population size, urgent conservation programs as well as genetic improvement strategies are needed to ensure sustainable utilization.\n",

      "The ability to conceptualize numerical quantities is an essential human trait. According to the “Triple Code Model” in numerical cognition, distinct neural substrates encode the processing of visual, auditory, and non-symbolic numerical representations. While our contemporary understanding of human number cognition has benefited greatly from advances in clinical imaging, limited studies have investigated the intracranial electrophysiological correlates of number processing. In this study, 13 subjects undergoing stereotactic electroencephalography for epilepsy participated in a number recognition task. Drawing upon postulates of the Triple Code Model, we presented subjects with numerical stimuli varying in representation type (symbolic vs. non-symbolic) and mode of stimuli delivery (visual vs. auditory). Time-frequency spectrograms were dimensionally reduced with principal component analysis and passed into a linear support vector machine classification algorithm to identify regions associated with number perception compared to inter-trial periods. Across representation formats, the highest classification accuracy was observed in the bilateral parietal lobes. Auditory (spoken and beeps) and visual (Arabic) number formats preferentially engaged the superior temporal cortices and the frontoparietal regions, respectively. The left parietal cortex was found to have the highest classification for number dots. Notably, the putamen exhibited robust classification accuracies in response to numerical stimuli. Analyses of spectral feature maps revealed that non-gamma frequency, below 30 Hz, had greater-than-chance classification value and could be potentially used to characterize format specific number representations. Taken together, our findings obtained from intracranial recordings provide further support and expand on the Triple Code Model for numerical cognition.\n",

      "The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding significantly within medical research and, to some extent, in clinical practice. Deep learning (DL) applications, which use large convolutional neural networks (CNN), hold considerable potential, especially in optimizing radiological evaluations. However, training DL algorithms to clinical standards requires extensive datasets, and their processing is labor-intensive. In this study, we developed an annotation tool named DLLabelsCT that utilizes CNN models to accelerate the image analysis process. To validate DLLabelsCT, we trained a CNN model with a ResNet34 encoder and a UNet decoder to segment the pancreas on an open-access dataset and used the DL model to assist in annotating a local dataset, which was further used to refine the model. DLLabelsCT was also tested on two external testing datasets. The tool accelerates annotation by 3.4 times compared to a completely manual annotation method. Out of 3,715 CT scan slices in the testing datasets, 50% did not require editing when reviewing the segmentations made by the ResNet34-UNet model, and the mean and standard deviation of the Dice similarity coefficient was 0.82±0.24. DLLabelsCT is highly accurate and significantly saves time and resources. Furthermore, it can be easily modified to support other deep learning models for other organs, making it an efficient tool for future research involving larger datasets.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "In Ethiopia, Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) was integrated into the existing Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system in 2014. Despite providing valuable evidence to inform policies and actions, system implementation has not been evaluated. Thus, a national-level evaluation was conducted to assess the level and status of system implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "A national cross-sectional study was conducted using a multi-stage sampling approach in 2020. A total of 629 health facilities were included in the study. A modified tool, adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was employed to assess each functional component of the system, encompassing structure, core, supportive, and system attributes. The score for each component was based on Ethiopian Public Health Institute’s mid-term evaluation metrics. To objectively evaluate the implementation status, a composite score of the Maternal Death Surveillance and Response Performance Index (MDSRPI) was calculated based on five performance indicators. Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction were used to examine the variations in scores among the different characteristics.\n",

      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Of the total sample size, 82.5% (519/629) of health facilities were assessed. Among the assessed health facilities, 77.0% (400/519) fulfilled the criteria for final analysis. Accordingly, the overall readiness score was 44.9% (95% CI: 43.9% to 45.9%), which is rated as less functional. The structures of the system were rated at 51.7% (95% CI: 49.9% to 53.4%), and the system attributes were rated at 69.6% (95% CI: 68.0% to 71.2%), which were considered fairly functional. In contrast, the core functions were rated at 20.0% (95% CI: 18.9% to 21.1%), and the supportive functions were rated at 38.4% (95% CI: 36.4% to 40.4%), which were categorized as not functioning and less functional, respectively. Regionally, Tigray’s overall readiness score (54.8%, 95% CI: 50.4–59.1%) was significantly higher than Oromia (41.6%, 95% CI: 40.2–43.0%, P = 0.0001), Amhara (47.7%, 95% CI: 43.9–45.9%, P = 0.05), and SNNPR (42.3%, 95% CI: 39.3–45.3, P = 0.0001). Additionally, Amhara’s score was significantly higher than Oromia and SNNPR. Secondary-level healthcare facilities (49.6%, 95% CI: 45.7–53.7, P = 0.029) had a significantly higher readiness score compared to primary health facilities (44.6%, 95% CI: 43.5–45.6).

      "Background\n",
      "In clinical research, the most appropriate way to assess the effect of an intervention is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the field of rare diseases, conducting an RCT is challenging, resulting in a low rate of clinical trials, with a high frequency of early termination and unpublished trials. The aim of the EPISTOP trial was to compare outcomes in infants with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who received vigabatrin preventively before the seizures onset with those who received it conventionally after. The study was designed as a prospective, multicentre, randomized clinical trial. However, ethics committees at four centres did not approve this RCT design, resulting in an open-label trial (OLT) in these four centres and an RCT in the other six centres. In this paper, we re-analyse the data from the EPISTOP trial using methods to investigate the influence of allocation bias on the results of the EPISTOP trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method\n",
      "A bias-corrected analysis is used to support and strengthen the published results. We included a term representing the effect of selection bias as an influencing factor on the corresponding endpoint in the statistical model. Thus, the treatment effect estimates for the primary endpoint of time to first seizure and additional secondary endpoints are adjusted for the bias effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Result\n",
      "The bias-corrected analyses for the primary endpoint show that the estimated hazard ratio and associated confidence intervals are in a very similar range (original analysis: HR 2.91, 95%-CI [1.11 to 7.67], p-value 0.0306; bias-corrected analysis: HR 2.89, 95%-CI [1.10 to 7.58], p-value 0.0316).

However, this highlights that this aspect needs to be considered in future trials, especially in rare diseases, to avoid additional biases in an already small sample size where it may be difficult to reach significance.\n",

      "To find an effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2, Quercetin’s chemical structure was compared to nine ligands associated with nine key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. It was found that Quercetin closely resembles Remdesivir, the co-crystallized ligand of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This similarity was confirmed through flexible alignment experiments and molecular docking studies, which showed that both Quercetin and Remdesivir bind similarly to the active site of RdRp. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a 200 ns trajectory, analyzing various factors like RMSD, RG, RMSF, SASA, and hydrogen bonding were conducted. These simulations gave detailed insights into the binding interactions of Quercetin with RdRp compared to Remdesivir. Further analyses, including MM-GBSA, Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints (ProLIF) and Profile PLIP studies, confirmed the stability of Quercetin’s binding. Principal component analysis of trajectories (PCAT) provided insights into the coordinated movements within the systems studied. In vitro assays showed that Quercetin is highly effective in inhibiting RdRp, with an IC50 of 122.1 ±5.46 nM, which is better than Remdesivir’s IC50 of 21.62 ±2.81 μM. Moreover, Quercetin showed greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 In vitro, with an IC50 of 1.149 μg/ml compared to Remdesivir’s 9.54 μg/ml. The selectivity index (SI) values highlighted Quercetin’s safety margin (SI: 791) over Remdesivir (SI: 6). In conclusion, our comprehensive study suggests that Quercetin is a promising candidate for further research as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, providing valuable insights for developing an effective anti-COVID-19 treatment.\n",

      "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) before 37 weeks of gestation is a common obstetrical event, whose pathophysiology is still poorly understood. Our objective was to study the mechanical strength of fetal membranes in women with a clinical risk factor for preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).\n",

      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We included, in a prospective, descriptive, single-center study, patients scheduled for cesarean section at term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation). For each patient, we performed uniaxial tensile tests on fetal membranes with a universal testing machine equipped with a force sensor (EZ20®, Lloyds), allowing the recording of an applied force/time curve. We collected maximum force (Fmax), maximum stress (σMax), and Young’s modulus of elasticity. The thickness of each membrane sample was also measured. We compared the values obtained according to certain clinical risk factors for PPROM such as age, body mass index, gravidity, parity, a history of PPROM or preterm birth, smoking, gestational diabetes, geographic origin, and socioeconomic level.\n",

      "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disability characterized by a range of brain- and body-based difficulties which, when left unsupported, can lead to experiences of significant adversity across the lifespan. Caregivers of individuals with FASD play a critical role in advocating and supporting healthy outcomes for individuals with FASD, and most caregiver research to date has been focused on stressors and challenges. Very few studies have been conducted to systematically capture the full experience of caring for someone with FASD across the lifespan, including perspectives, concerns, as well as strengths and successes of caregivers and their families. Collaborative research with individuals with living experience is essential for understanding needs and supporting healthy outcomes for individuals with FASD and their families, and caregivers are in a unique and important position to provide perspectives and share living expertise. Therefore, the current study was developed collaboratively with caregivers and researchers to capture the many aspects of caregivers’ contexts, concerns, needs, and successes in raising individuals with FASD. In this study protocol paper, we describe the rationale, development, design, and anticipated impacts of this research. The goal of this paper is to share information about why and how this study is being done, and potentially guide other teams in developing similar projects to better understand caregivers’ experiences, needs, and successes. Documenting and giving voice to the breadth and depth of caregiver experiences will help us to tailor services and supports, develop resources, stimulate knowledge translation based in resilience and protective factors, guide future studies, and inform evidence-based policy initiatives.\n",

In contrast, no statistically significant difference in the genotypes of CD40L (rs1126535) was detected between laryngeal cancer patients and the control group (p = 0.12). Additionally, no significant differences in serum sCD40 or sCD40L levels were observed between the groups (p = 0.48 and p = 0.15, respectively). However, a moderate positive correlation was found between sCD40 and sCD40L levels in the laryngeal cancer group (r = 0.52, p<0.01), a relationship that was not observed in the control group.\n",

      "According to the current findings, it is suggested that the CD40 (rs1883832) gene variation found in patients may indicate an individual’s susceptibility to developing laryngeal cancer. On the other hand, CD40L (rs1126535) seems to not play a significant role. While serum sCD40 and sCD40L levels did not show significant differences between patients and controls, the correlation in cancer patients suggests that these markers may be relevant in tumor progression. Further research is required to clarify the functional implications of these genetic variants and their potential use as biomarkers for laryngeal cancer.\n",

      "Disease burden associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in low- and middle-income countries has been on an increasing trend in the past decades. Despite the worldwide genetic, cultural, and environmental variations in determinants of CVDs, few studies have attempted the identification of risk factors of CVDs in low- and middle-income countries. This article aims to introduce the Khánh Hòa Cardiovascular Study, a prospective cohort study among middle-aged community dwellers in rural Khánh Hòa, Vietnam. A total of 3000 individuals, aged 40–60 years at baseline, participated in the baseline survey conducted from June 2019 to June 2020 and will be followed up for the subsequent 10 years. The baseline survey collected information on sociodemographic variables, disease history, lifestyle, social environment, and mental health via questionnaires, physical examinations, and biochemical measurements. Information on the incidence of severe health outcomes (i.e., mortality, CVDs, and cancer) has been and will be collected using a study-specific disease registry. Results showed that the prevalences of excess body weight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were 25.9%, 39.6%, 10.2%, and 45.1%, respectively. Furthermore, by March 2023, 21 participants had died, including 5 CVD deaths and 12 cancer deaths. Moreover, we recorded 22 and 31 cases of nonfatal CVDs and cancer, respectively. These results suggest that many rural residents in Vietnam have high cardiometabolic risk, and underscore the importance of advancing research to identify risk factors and prevent the onset of serious health events.\n",

      "This study examines the relationship between virtual social interaction and people’s social behaviors and psychology using algorithm matching technologies and questionnaire surveys. The focus is on interpersonal communication on virtual social platforms. The findings indicate that engaging in virtual social networking is often accompanied by a high level of loneliness. Users who experience social anxiety in the real world tend to feel more lonely, and this loneliness is exacerbated by presenting an unreal version of oneself and having distrust in virtual social networking. Users with higher anxiety and loneliness levels are more likely to use the algorithm matching function of virtual social networking, engage in false self-presentation, and have less trust in the platform. Since the inherent flaws of virtual social networking cannot be eliminated solely through algorithm matching, a potential solution is to introduce more offline to online social functions for strangers. This exploration of actual matching on social platforms may help reduce users’ loneliness.\n",

      "In modern medical imaging-assisted therapies, manual annotation is commonly employed for liver and tumor segmentation in abdominal CT images. However, this approach suffers from low efficiency and poor accuracy. With the development of deep learning, automatic liver tumor segmentation algorithms based on neural networks have emerged, for the improvement of the work efficiency. However, existing liver tumor segmentation algorithms still have several limitations: (1) they often encounter the common issue of class imbalance in liver tumor segmentation tasks, where the tumor region is significantly smaller than the normal tissue region, causing models to predict more negative samples and neglect the tumor region; (2) they fail to adequately consider feature fusion between global contexts, leading to the loss of crucial information; (3) they exhibit weak perception of local details such as fuzzy boundaries, irregular shapes, and small lesions, thereby failing to capture important features. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Axis Attention Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, referred to as MA-cGAN. Firstly, we propose the Multi-Axis attention mechanism (MA) that projects three-dimensional CT images along different axes to extract two-dimensional features. The features from different axes are then fused by using learnable factors to capture key information from different directions. Secondly, the MA is incorporated into a U-shaped segmentation network as the generator to enhance its ability to extract detailed features. Thirdly, a conditional generative adversarial network is built by combining a discriminator and a generator to enhance the stability and accuracy of the generator’s segmentation results. The MA-cGAN was trained and tested on the LiTS public dataset for the liver and tumor segmentation challenge. Experimental results show that MA-cGAN improves the Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, average surface distance, and other metrics compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation models. The segmented liver and tumor models have clear edges, fewer false positive regions, and are closer to the true labels, which plays an active role in medical adjuvant therapy. The source code with our proposed model are available at https://github.com/jhliao0525/MA-cGAN.git.\n",

      "Embryonic development in humans is controlled by the Hedgehog pathway, which becomes inactive in mature tissues. Except for tissue maintenance and healing, activation of this pathway results in tumorigenesis with only a few exceptions. The drugs currently in use have shown no effectiveness in blocking the key proteins responsible for tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is crucial to find new inhibitors that can stop the abnormal activation of the pathway. A preliminary Insilco screening of naturally occurring compounds was carried out to identify potential inhibitors of the pathway. Docking of seventeen naturally occurring antitumorigenic compounds against the four key proteins of the regulatory proteins of the Hedgehog pathway using AutoDock v4.2.6 software was carried out. Liriodenine exhibited the strongest binding affinity towards three out of the four regulatory proteins (-7.61 kcal/mol with Smoothened, -8.14 kcal/mol with Patched-I, and -6.15 kcal/mol with Gli-II) of the Hedgehog pathway, whereas 2’,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxychalcone displayed the highest binding affinity of -7.04 kcal/mol with the Sonic Hedgehog protein. Additional molecular dynamic simulation was conducted using Gromacs with Liriodenine and 2’,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxy chalcone. Every protein-ligand complex underwent simulation using v5.1.4 software for a duration of 100 nanoseconds. The findings from the simulation indicate that Liriodenine and 2’,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxy chalcone form a strong bond with their corresponding protein. Our findings show that the two aforementioned molecules have potential as new inhibitors of the pathway and should be further investigated in both invitro and in vivo experiments.\n",

      "Ammonia is widely acknowledged to be a stressor and one of the most detrimental gases in animal enclosures. In livestock- and poultry-breeding facilities, a precise, rapid, and affordable method for detecting ammonia concentrations is essential. We design and develop an electronic nose system containing a bionic chamber that imitates the nasal-cavity structure of humans and canines. The sensors are positioned based on fluid simulation results. Response data for ammonia and ethanol gases and the response/ recovery times of an ammonia sensor under three concentrations are collected using the electronic nose system. Response data are classified and regressed using a sparrow search algorithm (SSA)-optimized backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The results show that the sensor has a relative mean deviation of 1.45%. The ammonia sensor’s output voltage is 1.3–2.05 V when the ammonia concentration ranges from 15 to 300 ppm. The ethanol gas sensor’s output voltage is 1.89–3.15 V when the ethanol gas concentration ranges from 8 to 200 ppm. The average response time of the ammonia sensor in the chamber is 13 s slower than that of the sensor directly exposed to the gas being measured, while the average recovery time is 19 s faster. In tests comparing the performance of the SSA-BPNN, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models, the SSA-BPNN achieves a 99.1% classification accuracy, better than the SVM and RF models. It also outperforms the other models at regression prediction, with smaller absolute, mean absolute, and root mean square errors. Its coefficient of determination (R2) is greater than 0.99, surpassing those of the SVM and RF models. The theoretical and experimental results both indicate that the proposed electronic nose system containing a bionic chamber, when used with the SSA-BPNN, offers a promising approach for detecting ammonia in livestock- and poultry-breeding facilities.\n",

      "Flaviviruses are a diverse group of RNA viruses known for their significant impact on human health worldwide. We generated a series of reporters that included cleavage sequences from the dengue virus type 2 polyprotein and co-transfected with plasmids encoding various flavivirus proteases into Aedes aegypti cells, followed by fluorescent imaging and western blot analysis for the determination of proteolytic cleavage. Recombinant flavivirus NS2B3 proteases from medically significant and insect-specific flaviviruses were able to process reporters encoding cleavage sequences from the dengue virus type 2 polyprotein in vitro including proteases from dengue virus types 1–4, Zika virus, yellow fever virus, Aedes flavivirus, and cell-fusing agent virus. Reporters were not cleaved when transfected cells were infected with dengue virus type 2. Endoplasmic reticulum tethered reporters were also cleaved by protease alone but not by infectious virus. These results shed light on the ability of multiple flavivirus proteases to cleave sequences derived from outside of their genome and raise new questions concerning the requirements for effective cleavage by flavivirus proteases in trans.\n",

In East African countries, particularly Rwanda, there is a known prevalence of low sodium intake, with a mean sodium intake of 1.6 g/day. However, despite this dietary habit, the national protocol for treating hypertension, as well as common clinical practice, often fail to account for the low salt intake in Rwandan communities. Hypertensive patients are still frequently advised to reduce their salt intake, and in some cases, they are instructed to eliminate salt entirely.\n",

      "Detection of Strogyloides-specific IgG antibodies in urine and serum has been used in diagnostic and epidemiological studies on strongyloidiasis. However, the usefulness of these assays in assessing responses to anthelmintic treatment is unclear. Thus, we evaluated the diagnostic performance and temporal profiles of Strongyloides-specific IgG antibodies in a cohort of participants at baseline and post-treatment. The participants were prospectively screened for baseline parasitic infections by fecal examination [agar plate culture technique (APCT) and formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT)] and digital droplet polymerase reaction (ddPCR) for Strongyloides stercoralis. At each sampling point, Strongyloides-specific IgG in urine and serum were measured by an in-house S. ratti-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At baseline, 169 of 351 participants (48.1%) had S. stercoralis infection by the combined fecal examination and ddPCR. The diagnostic sensitivities of IgG in urine and serum were 91.1% and 88.2%, respectively. The participants were given treatment with a single oral dose of ivermectin (IVM, 200 μg/kg) and were followed up by fecal and immunological diagnosis at 3 to 18 months post-treatment. The cure rate of IVM treatment evaluated by APCT and ddPCR was 88.3% at three months post-treatment. The profiles of IgG in urine in the curative treatment group showed a significant trend of decline with time post-treatment (Kruskal-Wallis test = 113.4–212.6, p value < 0.0001) and the lowest levels were seen 12 months post-treatment. The treatment response (> 50% reduction in urinary IgG antibody units) was 100%, and conversion from positive to negative results was 65.4%. The treatment response and conversion to negative assessed by serum IgG-ELISA were similar to those by urine IgG-ELISA. The results from this long-term diagnostic study highlight the utility of urinary IgG and serum IgG for screening and monitoring treatment outcomes in strongyloidiasis.\n",

      "This study aimed to discuss the pathogenic hereditary factors of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in Guangxi, China. We recruited 89 patients with SRNS or infantile NS from five major pediatric nephrology centers in Guangxi, and conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data. Whole-exome sequencing analysis was also performed on all patients. The risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. The study included 69 male and 20 female participants from 86 distinct families, with the median age of disease onset being 48 months (interquartile range: 24–93). Overall, 24.7% had a family history of SRNS, whereas 13.5% exhibited extra-kidney manifestations. We identified disease-causing variants in 24.7% (22/89) of patients across eight screened genes. The most frequently detected variant was found in COL4A5, followed by NPHS2 (5.6%), NPHS1 (2.2%), PAX2 (2.2%), WT1 (1.1%), LMX1B (1.1%), NUP105 (1.1%), and COL4A6 (1.1%). Twelve of the 26 pathogenic variants were determined to be de novo. Based on gene detection results, pathogenic variants were categorized into two groups: identified and unidentified variants. The identified variant group demonstrated a significant association with positive family history, steroid resistant-style, and response to immune therapy (P<0.001). Patients with the identified genetic variant were approximately ten times more likely to develop CKD (P<0.001) than those in the unidentified group at the last follow-up. Kidney biopsy was performed on 66 patients, and minimal change disease was the most prevalent histopathological diagnosis (29 cases; 32.6%). These findings suggest that children diagnosed with SRNS exhibit a diverse range of genetic alterations. We identified the COL4A5 variant as the predominant genetic abnormality and a low frequency of NPHS1 gene involvement in these children. Gene variants may serve as an independent predictor for SRNS progression to CKD.\n",

      "With increasing life expectancy, knee pain has become more prevalent, highlighting the need for early prediction. Although X-rays are commonly used for diagnosis, knee pain and X-ray findings do not always match. This study aims to identify factors contributing to knee pain in individuals with both normal and abnormal knee X-ray results to bridge the gap between X-ray findings and knee pain. Data from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), collected from 2010 to 2012, including data from 5,191 participants, were analyzed. The focus was on epidemiological characteristics, medical histories, knee pain, and X-ray grades. Multivariate logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were used to predict knee pain in individuals with normal and abnormal knee X-rays, categorized by Kellgren-Lawrence grades. For normal X-rays, the logistic regression model identified aging, being female, higher BMI, lower fat percentage, osteoporosis, depression, and rural living as factors associated with knee pain. The XGBoost model highlighted BMI, age, and sex as key predictors, with a feature importance >0.1. For abnormal X-rays, logistic regression indicated that aging, being female, higher BMI, osteoporosis, depression, and rural living were associated with knee pain. The XGBoost model highlighted age, BMI, sex, and osteoporosis as key predictors, with a feature importance >0.1. Aging and being female were associated with knee pain due to hormonal changes in women, as well as cartilage and bone deterioration. Lower fat percentage was significantly associated with increased pain, which might be attributable to higher activity levels. Higher BMI and osteoporosis were significantly associated with knee pain, possibly due to increased stress and reduced resistance on knee structures, respectively. Depression was identified as a key predictor of knee pain in patients with normal X-rays, potentially attributable to psychosomatic factors. The study’s limitations include its cross-sectional nature, which does not allow for the establishment of causal relationships, the lack of detailed medical history such as trauma history, and recall bias due to self-reported questionnaires. Future research should address these limitations to support our hypothesis.\n",

      "In a world rapidly transitioning, food consumption away from home is rising, therefore representing an increasing share of individual’s diet. Food consumed away from home negatively impacts diet, nutritional status and consequently has detrimental effects on health. In some contexts, where individual level dietary intake surveys are not regularly conducted, this behavior is not well documented leading to a gap of knowledge. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate in Burkina Faso and Vietnam specific modules that could be added to Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys that are usually regularly conducted worldwide, in order to document the economic and nutritional importance of food consumption away from home. In each country, two survey modules, one long (100 food items) and one short (30 food items) were developed, to measure individual-level food consumption away from home over the last 7 days. The modules were relatively validated in comparison with data from three non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls conducted over the same 7-days period. The validation was conducted in different settings (urban, peri-urban and rural) in Burkina Faso (n = 924) and Vietnam (n = 918). In both countries, a good concordance between the 24-hour dietary recalls and the modules in their ability to identify a person as having consumed food away from home (>77%) was found. However, in both countries, both modules underestimate the mean energy intake coming from foods consumed away from home (from 122 to 408 kcal) while they overestimate the budget allocated to it (from -0.07 to -0.29 USD/day). None of developed food away from home modules were considered as valid. There is a need for the international community to continue to work on developing and validating tools capable to estimate nutritional intakes related to food consumption away from home and that could be added to regular national household-level surveys.\n",

      "The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in influencing various physiological processes and maintaining overall well-being, including the gastric system. Current diagnostic tests for gastric diseases often involve invasive procedures, sampling limitations, and medication effects, leading to potential diagnostic errors and discomfort to patients. Considering the connection between oral and gastric microbiomes, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the diagnostic potential of the oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing upper digestive endoscopy. Oral samples from 266 participants across two Brazilian sites (Belterra and Sao Paulo) were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analysis to identify microbiome composition across endoscopy outcome groups, exploring alpha and beta-diversity, richness, and differential abundance and prevalence. Prevotella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and Streptococcus were the most abundant genera observed. No significant associations were found between alpha diversity profiles and endoscopy outcomes; beta diversity analyses similarly showed no correlations. Overall, the study did not establish the oral microbiome as a reliable marker for gastric health, underscoring the necessity for broader studies in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tests.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Alopecia Areata (AA) is an autoimmune condition where the activation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses is known to stimulate other white blood cells, potentially affecting hematopoietic lineages. However, previous studies on AA have found no utility in hematological ratios. Our goals were to compare neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), eosinophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (ELR), eosinophils-to-neutrophils ratio (ENR), and eosinophils-to-monocytes ratio (EMR) between patients with AA and controls, as well as between mild and moderate-severe AA cases.\n",

      "Methods and findings\n",
      "We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study involving adult patients enrolled in the largest national health maintenance organization in Israel. The study comprised 147,020 AA patients and 141,598 healthy controls. AA patients exhibited a higher likelihood of elevated NLR and ELR compared to controls. Upon further classification based on severity, moderate-severe AA patients displayed higher values of NLR, PLR, ELR, and EMR compared to mild AA individuals OR = 1.11 [1.09–1.1], P<0.001; OR = 1.09 [1.05–1.13], P<0.001; OR = 2.06 [1.67–2.53], P<0.001; OR = 1.07 [1.03–1.07)], P<0.001, respectively).

      "Context\n",
      "The COVID-19 emergency warrants reflection on how to improve future infectious disease pandemic preparedness and response (PPR). U.S. States took diverse approaches to COVID-19, with Florida’s approach characterized by fewer restrictions on businesses and individuals. Despite the profound effects of the pandemic, there is a dearth of stakeholder-informed recommendations for PPR at the state level. This study aims to empirically examine stakeholder perspectives on PPR in Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with former and current leaders from government, academia, and the private sector in Florida. Participants were asked about challenges encountered during COVID-19 and considerations for what should be done for future pandemics. Interview transcripts and notes were analyzed using qualitative content analysis (QCA).\n",

      "Findings\n",
      "Results were organized into four main categories (recommendations for future actions, challenges in PPR, successes and failures during the COVID-19 response), across which six sub-categories were identified: public health systems capacities; mitigation of disease transmission; roles and relationships; messaging and information dissemination; minimizing other adverse effects of a pandemic; and public health culture. Considering the neglect of existing pandemic plans and jurisdictional tensions around decision-making during COVID-19, participants proposed implementing a pandemic playbook that delineates the responsibilities of relevant agencies and processes of waiving standard procedures. While many suggested closures and restrictions to avoid the spread of disease, others questioned the extent to which such strategies should be implemented.\n",

Participants defined successful pandemic response as not only comprising the mitigation of disease transmission, but also the minimization of adverse social and economic effects. Participants discussed strategies for a unified, well-coordinated approach to future pandemics that balances health and economic concerns.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecologic malignancies. Despite recent advancements in targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors, recurrence is common and frequently resistant to existing therapies. A powerful diagnostic tool, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of its implications, is crucial. HE4, a clinical serum biomarker for ovarian cancer, has shown efficacy in monitoring malignant phenotypes, yet little is known about its biological role and regulatory mechanisms. Our research demonstrates that HE4 expression in ovarian cancer can be regulated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. We found that the activation of NF-κB signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a cytokine found in ovarian cancer tumors and ascites, enhanced the secretion of HE4 while its inhibition suppressed HE4 levels. Nuclear translocation of the NF-κB component p65 was found to be critical for HE4 expression; induced NF-κB activation through p65 expression or constitutive IKK2 activity elevated HE4 expression, while p65 knockdown had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we observed that NF-κB mediated HE4 expression at the transcriptional level. Our data also suggests that there is a regulatory role for HE4 in the expression of α5-Integrin, a crucial adhesion molecule in ovarian cancer metastasis; HE4 knockdown corresponded with reduced α5-Integrin expression, cell migration and cell adhesion to fibronectin.\n",

      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study including 2165 cancer patients treated with ICIs between 2013 and 2020. The primary outcome was adverse cardiovascular events (ACE): a composite of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, valvular disease, pericardial disease, and myocarditis. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and the individual components of ACE. We additionally conducted an imaging substudy examining imaging characteristics from echocardiography (echo) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "In our cohort, 44% (n = 962/2165) of patients experienced ACE. In a multivariable analysis, dual ICI therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.45), age (HR 1.01, CI 1.00–1.01), male sex (HR 1.18, CI 1.02–1.36), prior arrhythmia (HR 1.22, CI 1.03–1.43), lung cancer (HR 1.17, CI 1.01–1.37), and central nervous system (CNS) malignancy (HR 1.23, CI 1.02–1.47), were independently associated with increased ACE. ACE was independently associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of mortality (P<0.001). Dual ICI therapy was also associated with a 2.0-fold increased risk of myo/pericarditis (P = 0.045), with myo/pericarditis being associated with a 2.9-fold increased risk of mortality (P<0.001). However, the cardiovascular risks of dual ICI therapy were offset by its mortality benefit, with dual ICI therapy being associated with a ~25% or 1.3-fold decrease in mortality. Of those with echo prior to ICI initiation, 26% (n = 115/442) had abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction or global longitudinal strain, and of those with echo after ICI initiation, 28% (n = 207/740) had abnormalities. Of those who had CMR imaging prior to ICI initiation, 43% (n = 9/21) already had left ventricular dysfunction, 50% (n = 10/20) had right ventricular dysfunction, 32% (n = 6/19) had left ventricular late gadolinium enhancement, and 9% (n = 1/11) had abnormal T2 imaging.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "Dual ICI therapy, prior arrhythmia, older age, lung and CNS malignancies were independently associated with an increased risk of ACE, and dual ICI therapy was also independently associated with an increased risk of myo/pericarditis, highlighting the utmost importance of cardiovascular risk factor optimization in this particularly high-risk population. Fortunately, the occurrence of myo/pericarditis was relatively uncommon, and the overall cardiovascular risks of dual ICI therapy appeared to be offset by a significant mortality benefit. The use of multimodal cardiac imaging can be helpful in stratifying risk and guiding preventative cardiovascular management in patients receiving ICIs.\n",

      "Circulating CD34-positive cell count is inversely associated with height loss. It acts as an indicator of endothelial repair activity. In conjunction with CD34-positive cells, platelets contribute to endothelial repair. The presence of hypertension increases the demand for endothelial repair. Therefore, platelet count could be associated with height loss among individuals with hypertension. A retrospective study of 2,343 individuals aged 40 to 79 years was conducted. Height loss was defined as being in the highest quartile of annual height decrease (1.6 mm/year for men and 2.0 mm/year for women). A significant inverse association between platelet count and height loss was observed only among participants with hypertension. After adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for height loss per 1 standard deviation increment in platelet count (5.09×104/μL for men and 5.03×104/μL for women) was 0.83 (0.70, 0.98) for participants with hypertension and 1.02 (0.90, 1.16) for participants without hypertension. Independent of known cardiovascular risk factors, platelets could prevent accelerated height loss among individuals with hypertension. Unlike CD34-positive cell count, platelet count and blood pressure, which are easy to assess in daily clinical practice, influence height loss.\n",

      "In diabetes mellitus (DM), the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including constipation, diarrhoea, gastroparesis, and/or enteropathy, can be up to ~75%. In this study, we compared three zebrafish larvae models of DM and established an analytical protocol for GI motility. Larvae were fed with either a standard diet (SD; control), or one of three diets to induce a DM-like phenotype: excessive feeding of SD food (ED), a high-fat diet (HFD), or exposing SD-fed larvae to 30 mmol/L glucose (SDG). DM was confirmed using a body-mass index, assessment of adipose deposit areas, two glucose assays, and one insulin assay. An analytical technique, whereby GI motility was quantified using pixel differences to track displacement along the centreline of the anterior, middle, and posterior intestine (AI, MI, and PI, respectively), was developed. Our results indicated that clear DM-like traits were observed in the HFD and SGD models, but not the ED model. In the SD controls, the AI showed similar anterograde and retrograde contractions indicating normal GI mixing; the MI exhibited more prominent forward contractions, and the PI showed distinct rectal waves. Compared to the SD, the HFD and SDG models exhibited significantly increased and decreased contraction velocities and could be used as models of diarrhoea and constipation in DM, respectively, while the ED model showed comparatively little change in motility. Together, these data indicate that complex changes in GI motility are associated with diet and therapeutics used to alleviate GI complications in DM should take these into account. Ultimately, the HFD and SDG models can be used to investigate different aspects of GI motility in association to DM. Hence, zebrafish are a useful model for studying GI dysfunctions due to DM and/or DM medication side-effects.\n",

      "Aspergillus fumigatus is a widely distributed pathogen responsible for severe infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Triazoles are the primary treatments options for Aspergillus infections; however, the emergence of acquired resistance to this antifungal class is becoming a growing concern. In this study, we investigated the potential of the antiviral drug, lopinavir (LPV) to restore the susceptibility of A. fumigatus strains to a set of azoles, while also reducing the required azole dosage for treatment of susceptible isolates. The combination of LPV with either itraconazole (ITC) or posaconazole (POS) demonstrated potent synergistic interactions against 16 out of 23 (~70%) and 21 out of 23 (~91%) A. fumigatus isolates, respectively. Moreover, the combination showed synergistic activity against other clinically important Aspergillus species, including A. niger, A. flavus, and A. brasiliensis. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) for the combinations ranged from 0.18 to 0.313 for ITC and 0.091 to 0.313 for POS, indicating strong synergistic effects. Further investigation revealed that efflux pump inhibition contributed to the synergy observed between azole and LPV. Morphological examination of the fungal cells subjected to this combinational therapy at sub-inhibitory doses showed the presence of carbohydrate granules/patches. The identification of LPV as a promising adjunct therapy holds promise for addressing the emerging challenge of azole resistance in Aspergillus species and improving treatment outcomes for patients.\n",

      "Interpersonal violence is a significant public health and human rights concern. People living with severe mental illness are especially vulnerable. The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda aims to end violence. To this end, we gathered information on the prevalence and factors associated with interpersonal violence among one of the most impacted groups: individuals with severe mental illness at Butabika Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2020, including individuals 18 years or older. Data was collected through a socio-demographics questionnaire and nine questions from the modified My Exposure to Community Violence Questionnaire. The assessment evaluated physical or sexual violence experience, frequency, and perpetrator identity. The data was analyzed using STATA version 12 through simple logistic regression to determine the correlation between a single exposure and the outcome of interest, with a significance level of 5%. Among 385 participants, the past year prevalence of overall reported interpersonal violence was about 34%, while physical and sexual reported interpersonal violence were approximately 29% and 11%, respectively. Participants who had perpetrated physical violence had higher odds of experiencing reported interpersonal violence. With increasing age, the odds of experiencing reported interpersonal violence decreased; compared to those aged 18–24 years, those aged 35–44 years had AOR = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.14–0.70, p = 0.005), and those aged 45 years and above had AOR = 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15–0.80, p = 0.013). Reported interpersonal violence was high among the participants. While individuals of older age had lower odds of reporting interpersonal violence, those who had perpetrated physical violence in the past year had higher odds. Screening for interpersonal violence among young patients is recommended. Psycho-education on preventing physical violence should be provided, especially to younger adults. The Ministry of Health should address violence against individuals with mental illness through mass sensitization. A prospective study could investigate risk and protective factors.\n",

      "Having a regular medical doctor is associated with better process of care and health outcomes. The goal of this study was to harness the richness in health administrative data to create a measure which accurately predicted whether patients self-identified as having a regular medical doctor. The Canadian Community Health Survey (2007–2012) was linked with health administrative data (HAD) (2002–2012) from Quebec, Canada’s second largest province. The Canadian Community Health Survey includes respondents’ answer to whether they have a regular medical doctor, but health administrative data does not. We therefore used LASSO and Random Forests to build prediction models that predict whether a patient reports having a regular medical doctor using their data only available in the HAD. Our results show that predicting patient responses to ‘do you have a regular medical doctor?’ using an average of single-year Usual Provider Continuity over 3 years results in an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.782 (0.778–0.787). This was almost a 14% improvement in predictive accuracy compared to the frequently used single-year Usual Provider Continuity (0.688 (0.683–0.694)). We have called this new measure the Reporting a Regular Medical Doctor (RRMD) index. The RRMD index is easy to implement in HAD, is an elegant solution to the difficulties associated with low-users having unstable UPC scores, and brings a patient-oriented perspective to previous efforts to capture patient-physician affiliations in HAD. We recommend that researchers seeking to measure whether patients have a regular medical doctor using HAD consider using the RRMD index.\n",

      "The stochastic rupture risk assessment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) critically depends on sufficient data set size that would allow for the proper distribution estimate. However, in most published cases, the data sets comprise no more than 100 samples, which is deemed insufficient to describe the tails of AAA wall thickness distribution correctly. In this study, we propose a stochastic Bayesian model to merge thickness data from various groups. The thickness data adapted from the literature were supplemented by additional data from 81 patients. The wall thickness was measured at two different contact pressures for 34 cases, which allowed us to estimate the radial stiffness. Herein, the proposed stochastic model is formulated to predict the undeformed wall thickness. Furthermore, the model is able to handle data published solely as summary statistics. After accounting for the different contact pressures, the differences in the medians reported by individual groups decreased by 45%. Combined data can be fitted with a lognormal distribution with parameters μ = 0.85 and σ = 0.32 which can be further used in stochastic analyses.\n",

      "An accelerometer-based device (postural sway-meter) is increasingly used for balance assessment, training, and fall prevention. However, limited information exists regarding its immediate effect on physical and cognitive performance, especially among middle-aged and older adults. This study aims to investigate the immediate effects of a balance training program using a postural sway-meter on balance, functional, and cognitive performance in adults over 50 years. This experimental study involved 72 participants aged 50 years and over, randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group underwent a 30-minute balance training session using the sway-meter with sound feedback (set at 75% of the stability limits at baseline). The control group participated in a 30-minute fall prevention knowledge session. The sway-meter measured balance during quiet stance and leaning. Functional performance was assessed using the multi-dimensional reach test (MDRT). Cognitive performance was evaluated through Trail Making Tests (TMT) A & B, as well as hand/foot reaction time assessments. Between-group comparisons at post-intervention showed no significant differences in balance, functional, and cognitive performance outcomes. Within-group analysis revealed a significant decrease in maximum reaching distance in the forward direction (MDRT) (p = 0.032, d = 0.31, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.78]) and the time to complete TMT-B (p = 0.036, d = 0.24, 95% CI [-0.22, 0.71]) in the intervention group. The control group showed a significant increase in COM angle sway excursion (lateral direction) (p = 0.011, d = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.19, 0.74]) and a decrease in TMT-A time (p = 0.031, d = 0.38, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.85]). Both groups significantly reduced hand reaction time (intervention: p = 0.036, d = 0.24, 95% CI [-0.22, 0.70]; control: p = 0.034, d = 0.20, 95% CI [-0.26, 0.66]) at post-intervention assessment. The findings of this study suggest that a single 30-minute balance training session using a postural sway-meter, delivered by a physiotherapist, is not only feasible and safe for community-dwelling older adults but also has the potential to significantly improve balance and cognitive outcomes. Enhancing the training program by increasing the amount of leaning and duration could further amplify these benefits, underscoring the need for a more robust training regimen.\n",

      "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is most prevalent in young adults, yet scarce evidence is available regarding South Korean young adults’ experience of IPV and culturally tailored IPV prevention programs. To address this gap, this study aimed to holistically assess IPV victimization and perpetration rates and the related risk and protective factors among Korean young adults. Using online survey data from 600 Korean young adults using simple random sampling, this study found that the lifetime prevalence of both IPV victimization and perpetration was about 30%. Both IPV victimization and perpetration had affected over 20% in the past 12 months. Independent variables in multiple logistic regression models explained 18% and 23% of variances in lifetime IPV victimization and perpetration, respectively. Korean young adults who reported more depressive symptoms were more likely to report IPV victimization. Those who reported more alcohol consumption, traditional attitudes about gender roles, being more tolerant of IPV, and poorer physical health status were also more likely to commit IPV. However, those who had experienced family neglect were less likely to report IPV perpetration. The findings of this study highlighted that childhood adverse experiences minimally explained IPV and that alcohol consumption, mental health, and attitudinal variables should be targets of IPV prevention among Korean young adults.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in 2020, has had a tremendous impact on various industries and the daily lives of the general populace, thereby contributing to increasing uncertainty in business competition. Property management enterprises, despite witnessing a mostly stagnant expansion and enhancement of their existing operations, have, owing to the unique nature of their services, continued to experience a relatively positive competitive environment. Notably, the recent emphasis in property management companies has been on the development of value-added services at the community level, which represents a critical avenue for securing a competitive edge by addressing consumer demands. This study, grounded in the ABC theory and the theory of planned behavior, seeks to analyze consumer attitudes towards the provision of value-added services by property management firms, including facets such as community healthcare services, community lifestyle amenities, community educational offerings, and personalized services. Moreover, the study delves into the mediating role played by satisfaction with fundamental property management services. The empirical findings emphasize the significant enhancement in consumer receptivity to property management firms’ value-added services, particularly in the domains of community healthcare, lifestyle amenities, education, and personalized services. In addition, it highlights the indirect effect of property owners’ contentment with essential property management services on their perspectives concerning the delivery of value-added services by property management firms. The implications of these research conclusions bear significant relevance for organizations engaged in offering such services.\n",

The visitor-employed photography technique, supplemented by a questionnaire survey, was used to explore visitors’ preferences for landscape elements and spatial sequences. The landscape elements were identified in eight categories (including vegetation, religious symbol, mountain, route, human, village, temple fair, and facility), and the spatial sequences of photos along the route were divided into containing views at close, middle, and remote distances. Visitors were classified into three types: those motivated by religious purposes, recreational purposes, and multiple purposes. It was concluded that visitors normally preferred the vegetative landscape and religious symbol categories, and they preferred to take photos with views at close distance (with cultural and aesthetic significance) in human settlements. Visitors motivated by different purposes showed different patterns of preferences for landscapes which are in consistent with their travel motivations. This study contributed to an in-depth interpretation of the people-place relationships and the enrichment of tourism motivation theory, and it could provide valuable references for the conservation, management, and planning of religious tourism destinations.\n",

      "Pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug, has been previously shown to ameliorate kidney damage through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we employed an integrative bioinformatics approach to study the possible mechanisms involved in the mitigative effect of pioglitazone against colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. Next, we validated the results obtained from the bioinformatics study by pre-treating human kidney-2 (HK-2) cell line with pioglitazone 100 μM for 30 minutes and then treating the cells with colistin sulfate 1200 μM for 24 hours. Inflammatory signaling by cytokines and the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways were predicted to be involved in the ameliorative effect of pioglitazone against colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. The nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 (NF-κB p65) and Nrf2 were among the predicted transcription factors regulating the hub genes. Moreover, miR-24, miR-16, and miR-21 were identified as potential pathogenic miRNAs regulating the hub genes. In contrast, miR-17, miR-27a, and miR-146a were identified as potential protective miRNAs. The in vitro study indicated that pioglitazone pre-treatment increased cell viability in HK-2 cells exposed to colistin. Pioglitazone pre-treatment reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL6 and TNF). Moreover, pioglitazone reduced the protein expression of NF-κB p65 and increased the protein expression of Nrf2. The protective effect of pioglitazone against colistin-induced toxicity in HK-2 cells is related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity through modulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling and Nrf2-mediated antioxidative stress signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "In 2021, 57 third-year pharmacy students from China Pharmaceutical University were randomly divided into a PBL group and a lecture-based learning (LBL) group. Mean scores were compared between the two groups for problem-solving, self-directed learning, communication skills, critical thinking, and final exam grades. Students’ feedback on the implementation of PBL was also collected. A meta-analysis was subsequently performed. Two authors independently conducted a comprehensive search of two databases (PubMed and CNKI). Eligible studies with effective data were included and the valuable data were extracted for analysis. Quality of involved studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. All analyses of statistics were conducted using the ‘metafor’ package in R software.\n",

      "We observed multiple gray bats (Myotis grisescens) in 2022 with large patches of fur loss (i.e., alopecia) on the dorsal surface of their body. Alopecia in wildlife has been linked to multiple possible factors and often is a sign of suboptimal health. In 2023, we designed an experiment to compare prevalence of alopecia in gray bats across various reproductive stages, characterize the severity of alopecia lesions, and determine the ectoparasites and microbiota present on the regions of fur loss. We harp-trapped four summer gray bat roosts 2–3 times between 11 April–30 August 2023 and collected skin swabs and scrapes from each bat with alopecia. We determined the severity of the alopecia lesions on a scale 0–7 by summing the degree of redness (0–2), skin condition (0–1), and percentage of fur loss (0–4). We cultured the skin swabs for fungal and bacterial growth and examined skin scrapes under a microscope to determine the presence of subcutaneous mites. We found no evidence that subcutaneous mites cause the fur loss. We determined that prevalence of alopecia in M. grisescens varies throughout the summer. Prevalence is highest for female bats that are or recently were lactating, reaching an average of 6% ± 6 SD (0–15% range) of captured females exhibiting fur loss during the pup rearing period. Alopecia is most prevalent in male bats in early summer (1% ± 2 SD; 0–4% range). Lactating females had more severe cases than males and were often associated with skin redness due to unknown causes. Bats with alopecia did not differ in body condition, determined from body mass, from bats without alopecia. Future studies could investigate the role of stress in possible autoimmune responses contributing to alopecia. Conservation strategies aimed at reducing stress and supporting nutritional requirements during the summer are likely beneficial to M. grisescens.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms, transmitted via mosquito bites. Significant global efforts have led to the interruption of LF transmission, with eight of the 16 previously endemic Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) validated by WHO as having eliminated the disease as a public health problem. Post-validation surveillance (PVS) is recommended to verify the absence of a resurgence in transmission; however, there are no guidelines on how to implement such surveillance effectively.\n",

      "Background and objectives\n",
      "End-of-life care supports individuals in the last few weeks or months of their life and their caregivers, offering psychosocial support, symptom management and relief, and resources. While some of the first public end-of-life care facilities were established due to HIV/AIDS, the current needs of caregivers for people living with end-stage HIV are not well understood. Caregivers provide two-thirds of the care for people living with HIV, yet their specific support needs and experiences are under-researched. Existing strategies often use a “one-size-fits-all” approach, which may not address the unique challenges faced by these caregivers, such as stigma and lack of social support. This study aims to synthesize the literature on the end-of-life care experiences and needs of caregivers for individuals living with HIV.\n",

An Information Specialist will assist in developing a search strategy to be applied across databases like Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Search results from each database will be imported into Covidence software for duplicate removal and title and abstract screening. Two researchers will independently screen studies using the ‘Population–Concept–Context’ (PCC) framework, with screening conducted at two levels: title and abstract, and full-text. The inclusion criteria will be piloted on a random sample of articles to ensure inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic >0.61).

Observational studies that estimate the prevalence or incidence or associated factors of HIV among FSWs, even if FSWs were not the main focus of the study, were included. The quality of included studies was assessed using Joana Brigg’s Institute checklist. Data were extracted and analyzed using STATA 17 software. To estimate the pooled effect sizes with their 95% confidence intervals, a random effect model was fitted. The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity. Funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were utilized to assess the small study effect. Publication bias was managed using trim-and-fill analysis.

      "Ensuring the sustainability of seafood is increasingly important for supporting food security and stable livelihoods in the face of a growing human population. A country’s seafood sustainability is often defined by how it manages its fisheries stocks; however, growth in the volume and complexity of global seafood trade has created an increasing disconnect between the sustainability of a country’s seafood production and their seafood consumption. Using a global seafood trade database, we demonstrate wide differences between country-specific sustainability of produced versus consumed seafood. Our findings suggest that countries most consistently considered leaders in seafood production sustainability will inevitably consume seafood held to lower sustainability standards through their participation in the global seafood trade network. This issue is exacerbated by an inability to accurately trace the origins of seafood products based on current international trade reporting practices. Our analysis suggests that improved international seafood tracing and sustainability metrics that account for both production and consumption are critical to future efforts to manage global seafood sustainability.\n",

      "Among older adults in Japan, those requiring long-term care who use visiting nursing services have particularly poor oral health. Given the importance of oral health, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of oral health improvement interventions for such older adult patients using visiting nursing services. This study was a single-arm pilot study. The participants were those who provide oral care to older adults who use visiting nursing services, whether the patients themselves or their family members. Participants implemented oral care appropriate to the patient’s oral environment at least once a day for four weeks. Feasibility assessment consisted of the recruitment, completion, and compliance rates. Changes in the oral environment were measured using the Oral Health Assessment Tool-Japanese (OHAT-J), and changes in scores were assessed over the study period. The study was conducted across three visiting nursing stations, with 52 participants (a recruitment rate of 73.2%). Of these, 42 participants completed the final questionnaire (a completion rate of 80.8%). The compliance rate was 64.3%. The mean OHAT-J score was 4.5 (SD 2.3) pre-intervention, 3.7 (SD 2.0) at one week post-intervention, and 3.6 (SD 2.2) at four weeks post-intervention (p < 0.001), indicating a significant positive trend. The feasibility of this intervention was generally satisfactory, and the results showed that the oral environment was improved. Future studies with a larger scale and higher level of evidence should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.\n",

      "Rehabilitation from musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) complicate healing dynamics typically by sustained disuse of bone and muscles. Microgravity naturally allows limb disuse and thus an effective model to understand MSKI. The current study examined epigenetic changes in a segmental bone defect (SBD) mouse model in a prolonged unloading condition after spaceflight (FLT). We further connected potential miRNA–mRNA regulatory pathways impacting bone healing. Here, SBD surgery was performed on nine-week-old male mice that were launched into space for approximately 4 weeks. Sham with no surgery and ground controls were included in the study. The midshaft of the ipsilateral femur (with callus on the surgical mice) as well as the ipsilateral quadriceps tissue were used for analysis. Femur and quadriceps had a distinct miRNA profile. There was a stronger surgery effect as observed by miRNA expression when compared to microgravity effects. Leukopoiesis, granulopoiesis, myelopoiesis of leukocytes, differentiation of myeloid leukocytes, and differentiation of progenitor cells were all altered because of surgery in the femur. The biological functions such as apoptosis, necrosis, and activation of cell migration and viability were altered because of surgery in quadriceps. Integrating the transcriptome and microRNA data indicated pronounced changes because of microgravity. According to pathway analysis, microgravity had a greater impact on the quadriceps tissue than the bone tissue in the absence of surgery. The altered biological functions resulting from microgravity were validated by integrating limited proteomics data to miRNA-mRNA. Thus, this study highlights the importance of dynamic interplay of gene-epigene regulations as they appear to be intrinsically interconnected and influence in combination for the biological outcome.\n",

      "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have therapeutic applications and potential for use in regenerative medicine. However, the use of hMSCs in research and clinical medicine is limited by a lack of information pertaining to their donor-specific functional attributes. In this study, we compared the characteristics of same-donor derived placenta (PL) and Wharton’s jelly (WJ)-derived hMSCs, we also compared their mechanism of action in a skeletal muscle disease in vitro model. The same-donor-derived hWJ- and hPL-MSCs exhibited typical hMSC characteristics. However, GRO-α was differentially expressed in hWJ- and hPL-MSCs. hWJ-MSCs, which secreted a high amount of GRO-α, displayed a higher ability to inhibit necroptosis in skeletal muscle cells than hPL-MSCs. This demonstrates the anti-necroptotic therapeutic effect of GRO-α in the skeletal muscle cell death model. Furthermore, GRO-α also exhibited the anti-necroptotic effect in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse model. Considering their potential to inhibit necroptosis in skeletal muscle cells, hWJ-MSCs and the derived GRO-α are novel treatment options for skeletal muscle diseases such as DMD.\n",

      "Survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) often face increased incidents of violence during stressful life events (SLEs) such as economic recessions, environmental disasters, and pandemics. These events can diminish the effectiveness of both formal (e.g., health, social, justice, labor, community) and informal (e.g., friends, family, neighbors) support systems. Additionally, SLEs exacerbate existing health and social inequities, making it necessary to understand the accessibility of support services during these times. This scoping review investigates access to services by individuals experiencing IPV during SLEs in high-income countries.\n",

      "Monitoring the volume and shape of residual limbs post-amputation is necessary to achieve optimal socket fit and determine overall limb health, yet contemporary clinical measurement techniques show high variance between measures. Three-dimensional scanning presents an opportunity for improved accuracy and reliability of residual limb measurements, however, three-dimensional scanners remain prohibitively expensive. A cost-effective alternative is the use of software that can utilise the photographs of modern smartphone cameras to create geometrically accurate scans. Whilst several studies have investigated the potential of privately developed photogrammetry algorithms for capturing residual limbs with clinical accuracy, none to the authors knowledge have explored commercially available software to do the same. Three applications were tested, namely Polycam, Luma, and Meshroom, to determine if they could produce clinically acceptable results. Scans of ten residual limbs were created using both smartphone technology and a reference structured-light scanner (Artec EVA), against which the validity and reliability of the resulting limb models were assessed using the Bland-Altman method and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, respectively. Polycam and Luma achieved both Pearson Coefficients and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of 0.999, and Coefficients of Variation of 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively. Volume reliability coefficients were 58.3 ml and 70.0 ml respectively for Polycam and Luma, whereas Meshroom failed to meet any of the criteria for clinical suitability, with a repeatability coefficient of 790.3 ml. Both Polycam and Luma exhibit sufficient accuracy and reliability to be considered for clinical volume measurements.\n",

      "There are contradicting perspectives regarding autistics’ ability to be creative. Some researchers cite autistics’ underlying social communication and interaction differences, fixated interests, and inflexible patterns as fundamentally inhibiting creativity. However, many autistics refute this mindset and produce creative works as painters, sculptors, photographers, and graphic artists. This protocol describes a mixed methods study that aims to determine the impact of art, storytelling, and STEAM-based approaches to develop autistic youth and young adult participants’ creative self-efficacy, psychological empowerment, and design thinking traits. The primary research question is: How does a 120-minute workshop intervention impact the creative self-efficacy of autistic participants? We hypothesize that autistic participants’ creative self-efficacy scores would linearly increase from the baseline measure. Exploratory research questions include: How does the workshop intervention affect the psychological empowerment and design thinking traits of the autistic participants? We hypothesize that autistic participants’ psychological empowerment and design thinking traits scores would linearly increase from the baseline measure. We will use a design-based implementation research approach that values the collaboration between the researchers and educators who design interventions to understand when, how, and why learning happens. Recruitment began on 10 November 2023 and ended on 9 August 2024. The study’s results are expected to be published in mid-2025. The study will provide crucial empirical evidence on the effects of an arts-based program on creative self-efficacy, psychological empowerment, and design thinking traits in autistic youth and young adults. We will use qualitative descriptive thematic analysis methods to analyze the digital images, stop motion videos, and participant presentations. Digital artifacts of the participants’ creative process and the study team’s analysis of the autistic youth’s presentations will provide additional data to understand the study phenomenon’s depth, meaning, and context. A mixed methods design is advantageous when exploring complex issues that require empirical evidence and contextual understanding.\n",

      "Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) tropical race 4 (TR4) severely affects banana production worldwide. Thus, specific PCR primers have been developed to rapidly diagnose and monitor Foc TR4-related fusarium wilt outbreaks in bananas. However, evaluation of these primers revealed room for improvement in the accuracy. This study aimed to design highly specific PCR primers based on genome data for Foc TR4 downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The specificity of the primers was assessed using Foc TR4, Foc races 1 and 2, and 15 other formae speciales strains. The utility of the primers was verified by correctly detecting Foc TR4 in 7 out of 86 isolates of Fusarium spp. obtained from banana farms in the Philippines. The primers allowed for rapid detection in experimentally diseased tissues. We concluded that this novel primer set enables the simplified diagnosis of fusarium wilt caused by Foc TR4 in bananas.\n",

Also, the vaginal temperature will be measured using a thermal camera, the pressure of the pelvic floor force (vaginal dynamometer) and a 1-hour Pad Test will be performed to quantify the urinary loss. With this procedure, we intend to obtain an overall better life quality and diminished symptoms in women with GSM. All assessments will be performed prior to the first irradiation and after the last one.\n",

      "Do neighborhoods have boundaries? Scholars have debated how neighborhoods should be operationalized for decades. While recent scholarship has de-emphasized boundaries, I argue that boundaries are focal to understanding what neighborhoods are and why they are so segregated. Relying on everyday mobility patterns data from a panel of 45 million nationally representative devices, I demonstrate that divisions between contiguous census block groups in terms of everyday mobility patterns align with divisions in race, educational attainment, occupation, and age. Employing a novel clustering procedure, I further demonstrate that sets of census block groups can be easily separated in terms of differences in mobility patterns, indicating that meaningful clusters and boundaries within cities do exist. Subsequent results indicate these clusters are uniquely segregated in terms of race, educational attainment, and age, highlighting how other spatial aggregations can underestimate true segregation. Additional results suggest that unique social processes divide these clusters from one another, as indicated by exceptional variation in both COVID-19 case incidence and criminal offense timing. While I do not believe these clusters represent objective “neighborhoods,” I do assert that they can serve as a useful geographical unit for social analyses. These clusters may also be useful for measuring segregation in mobility patterns as well as for studying mobility network resiliency.\n",

      "Assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is critical for diagnosis, staging, and management of kidney disease. However, accuracy of estimated GFR (eGFR) is limited by large errors (>30% error present in >10–50% of patients), adversely impacting patient care. Errors often result from variation across populations of non-GFR determinants affecting the filtration markers used to estimate GFR. We hypothesized that combining multiple filtration markers with non-overlapping non-GFR determinants into a panel GFR could improve eGFR accuracy, extending current recognition that adding cystatin C to serum creatinine improves accuracy. Non-GFR determinants of markers can affect the accuracy of eGFR in two ways: first, increased variability in the non-GFR determinants of some filtration markers among application populations compared to the development population may result in outlying values for those markers. Second, systematic differences in the non-GFR determinants of some markers between application and development populations can lead to biased estimates in the application populations. Here, we propose and evaluate methods for estimating GFR based on multiple markers in applications with potentially higher rates of outlying predictors than in development data. We apply transfer learning to address systematic differences between application and development populations. We evaluated a panel of 8 markers (5 metabolites and 3 low molecular weight proteins) in 3,554 participants from 9 studies. Results show that contamination in two strongly predictive markers can increase imprecision by more than two-fold, but outlier identification with robust estimation can restore precision nearly fully to uncontaminated data. Furthermore, transfer learning can yield similar results with even modest training set sample size. Combining both approaches addresses both sources of error in GFR estimates. Once the laboratory challenge of developing a validated targeted assay for additional metabolites is overcome, these methods can inform the use of a panel eGFR across diverse clinical settings, ensuring accuracy despite differing non-GFR determinants.\n",

      "Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) is present in the brain, but its interaction with the endocannabinoid system and phytocannabinoids is still not well understood. FABP7 has been proposed as a shuttle protein for trafficking endogenous cannabinoids, as well as an intracellular carrier of THC. In a mouse model of FABP7 global deletion, we used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to measure brain levels of Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as well as its primary metabolite, 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC), in male and female mice after acute inhalation of THC, compared to wild-type controls. We also measured brain levels of endogenous cannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) both at baseline and after acute THC inhalation. We found that in females, brain concentrations of 11-OH-THC were significantly reduced in FABP7-/- mice compared to FABP7+/+. Additionally, FABP7-/- females had significantly reduced AEA levels and significantly increased 2-AG levels in brain tissue compared to FABP7+/+. Vaporized THC administration had trending, but not significant, impacts on endocannabinoid concentrations in both males and females. Our findings suggest a sex-specific role of FABP7 in the metabolism of THC as well as the regulation of endocannabinoid levels in the brain.\n",

      "Characterising the transmission dynamics between various population groups is critical for implementing effective outbreak control measures whilst minimising financial costs and societal disruption. While recent technological and methodological advances have made individual-level transmission chain data increasingly available, it remains unclear how effectively this data can inform group-level transmission patterns, particularly in small, rapidly saturating outbreak settings. We introduce a novel framework that leverages transmission chain data to estimate group transmission assortativity; this quantifies the extent to which individuals transmit within their own group compared to others. Through extensive simulations mimicking nosocomial outbreaks, we assessed the conditions under which our estimator performs effectively and established guidelines for minimal data requirements in small outbreak settings where saturation may occur rapidly. Notably, we demonstrate that detecting and quantifying transmission assortativity is most reliable when at least 30 cases have been observed in each group, before reaching their respective epidemic peaks.\n",

      "The genus Enterococcus is increasingly recognized for its involvement in various human infections, with several species known to be pathogenic. This study characterized Enterococcus sp. SMC-9, isolated from bile of a patient with cholangitis, and compared its characteristics with those of Enterococcus montenegrensis CoE-012-22T, recently isolated from dried beef sausage. A comprehensive analysis, encompassing phylogenetic, genomic, and phenotypic studies, confirmed that strain SMC-9 belongs to the same species as E. montenegrensis CoE-012-22T. However, comparative genomic analysis revealed key differences in virulence and antibiotic resistance gene profiles between the two strains. Notably, genes related to exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway were found exclusively in strain SMC-9, suggesting their role in the strain’s colonization of the biliary tract and its involvement in cholangitis. Additionally, the tetracycline resistance gene tet(M), which was absent in E. montenegrensis CoE-012-22T, was identified in strain SMC-9, explaining its high tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentration (>16 μg/mL). These findings highlight the unique pathogenic traits of strain SMC-9 compared to E. montenegrensis CoE-012-22T. Our study underscores the significant genetic and phenotypic variations that can exist among strains within the same species, highlighting the critical need for strain typing to assess their potential impact on patient outcomes and public health.\n",

      "Reasoning is the ability to formulate inferences or conclusions from available information. The two major types, deductive and inductive, are thought to rely on distinct cognitive mechanisms and recruit separate brain areas. Neuroimaging studies yield mixed results; some found the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activations for deductive reasoning and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for inductive reasoning. This assumption was put to the test in the present study. In two double-blinded, sham-controlled experiments, high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) was used to systematically explore the left IFG’s and DLPFC’s causal role in deductive and inductive reasoning. Participants with no formal training in logic judged deductive and inductive arguments before and after 10 minutes of anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS of the left IFG (Experiment 1, n = 20) or left DLPFC (Experiment 2, n = 21). Left IFG anodal tDCS impairs reaction times (RTs) for easy categorical (p = < .001) and propositional (p = .025) deductive arguments and the accuracy for easy inductive propositional arguments (p = .003). Meanwhile, regardless of the active stimulation conditions, left DLPFC tDCS shortens RTs (anodal: p = < .001, cathodal: p = .014) and increases accuracy (anodal: p = .029, cathodal: p = .001) for difficult categorical inductive arguments, but decreases accuracy (anodal: p = .027, cathodal: p = < .001) for difficult propositional inductive arguments. The overall results showed a partial dissociation of the left frontal lobe areas subserving the two types of reasoning and argument difficulty-dependent stimulation effects. This study extends knowledge of the neural basis of reasoning and hopefully inspires interventions that could augment reasoning impairments associated with normal aging and brain lesions.\n",

      "In recent years, additively manufactured metallic scaffolds have generated significant interest among researchers working in the field of bone tissue engineering and orthopaedic implants. Although such intricate, porous architectures are promising as bone substitutes, they need to be thoroughly tested for structural robustness as well as their capacity for bony integration. In this present work, we introduced and preclinically evaluated the biomechanical viability of Weaire-Phelan (WP) Ti-alloy scaffolds as bone replacement components. Two distinct groups of WP scaffolds, namely WPA and WPD, of varying porosities were examined for comparative assessment. Finite element (FE) analysis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and uniaxial compression tests were performed on 3D printed as-built scaffolds to comprehensively evaluate the structural, hemodynamic, fatigue and morphometric properties of the two groups. The mechanical performances of the WP scaffolds of 70%, 80% 90% porous group (relative density 0.3 and lower) were found to accord with the natural trabecular bone tissue. However, WPA scaffolds demonstrated slightly superior mechanical performances as compared to WPD scaffolds (22%– 63% greater compressive modulus depending on the porosity). On the other hand, WPD scaffolds showed improved hemodynamic properties thereby implying enhanced osteogenic potential. Moreover, the range of effective elastic moduli corresponding to the WP scaffolds was found to be in good agreement with that of the natural bone tissue. As such, these designs were categorized based on their suitability at different anatomical sites. The overall performance metrics of the WP scaffolds underscore its potential for improved osseointegration, structural conformities and greater capacity for customization with enhanced manufacturability.\n",

      "The paper aims to investigate the interplay of sports athletic behavior between big-five personality traits and sports performance in China. The study acquired cross-sectional responses on the questionnaire from 260 Chinese sports athletes, including males and females. Fuzzy analysis techniques were applied to examine the results of the study. Fuzzy TODIM assessment, and fuzzy decision analysis technique applied to draw inferences. The results established that big-five personality traits are significant predictors of athletic behaviors; however, neuroticism is found to be insignificant. The interplay of athletic behavior of sports athletes is also significant in sports game performance. The role of athletic behavior in the nexus between personality traits and sports performance is also significant. Gender also has a significant role in behavior and sports performance. Chinese educational institutional and sports administrations should strive to encourage psychological training programs are enhance mental resilience for effective performance. Valuing sports opportunities for females to shape gender equality would promote sports performance at the school and college levels. Therefore, policy makers need to take such initiatives for a physically academic grooming of the individuals.\n",

      "Self-reported height and weight is widely used to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and yet little is known about factors that affect accuracy. This study investigated the motivational characteristics–narcissism and social desirability—that influence the accuracy of self-reported weight and how they interact with accountability (telling participants that their weight will be verified). A two-way between-subjects design was used (accountable vs not accountable) with motivational moderators (narcissism and social desirability). Participants (N = 80; Mean Age = 34.63; 58.8% Female) were randomly allocated to accountable (told that their weight would be verified in a follow-up lab session) or not-accountable (no information given) conditions. In Session 1, participants self-reported motivational (social desirability and narcissism) and anthropometric (height and weight) measures online. In Session 2 (24 hours later), objective measures of height and weight were taken in the lab. There was a significant interaction between condition and maladaptive narcissism level. Being told that weight would be later verified improved accuracy of self-reported weight, but only for those low in maladaptive narcissism. Accountability improves the accuracy of self-report weight data, but not for individuals high in narcissism. Though based on a modest sample, these findings suggest that the under-estimation of self- report weight serves a self-protective function and maladaptive narcissism may be a useful covariate to include in research using self-report weight estimates.\n",

      "Identifying and understanding prenatal developmental disorders at an early stage are crucial as fetal brain development has long-term effects on an individual’s life. The maturation of the fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) is believed to influence the coordination and direction of maternal-fetal heartbeat synchronization. Fetal behavioral states (FBSes) include quiet sleep (1F), active sleep (2F), quiet awake (3F), and active awake (4F). In this study, the focus is on fetal movements, leading to the grouping of 1F and 3F into a quiet state, while 2F and 4F are combined to form an active state. Thus, the FBSes discussed in this article consist of fetal quiet and active states. Here, we explore the relationship between FBSes and the coupling of maternal and fetal heartbeats. We also seek to understand how maternal breathing patterns influence this coupling while considering FBSes. The study involved 105 healthy fetuses with gestational ages (GA) from 20 to 40 weeks. Non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were recorded for 3 to 10 minutes. The ECG samples were separated into three gestational groups (Early: 16 ≤ GA < 25, Mid: 25 ≤ GA < 32, and Late: 32 ≤ GA < 40 weeks). Maternal respiration rate and coupling strength parameters were calculated for various maternal-fetal heartbeat coupling ratios. The findings of the study indicated that FBSes influenced maternal-fetal HR coupling strength during late gestation but not during early and mid-gestation. The changes in maternal-fetal HR synchronization or communication as gestation progresses occur in both FBSes. Furthermore, we noticed a significantly higher level of maternal-fetal heartbeat synchronization during periods of higher respiratory rates when the fetus was in a quiet state. These results emphasize how FBSes impact the synchronization of maternal-fetal HR and contribute to the understanding of fetal growth and health.\n",

      "In this study, we introduce RecombiCraft, an innovative, rapid, and cost-efficient method for constructing DNA libraries in E. coli. This method uses seamless ligation cloning extract (SLiCE) coupled with liquid culture amplification to effectively minimize sequence biases. The technique capitalizes on the natural homologous recombination capabilities of E. coli cell lysates, eliminating the need for multiple purified enzymes and reducing costs. We first synthesized the library backbone and inserts via PCR, employing high-fidelity polymerase to minimize sequence bias. The SLiCE technique was then used to assemble the DNA fragments introduced into E. coli through electroporation. To ensure the integrity of the library, we optimized culture times based on next-generation sequencing analysis which confirmed the minimal sequence bias. The RecombiCraft method demonstrates that this approach is economical and maintains the library’s uniformity. By using liquid culture, this method can complete DNA library generation in about 12 hours and final extraction is simple, making it a promising tool for genetic research and biotechnology applications.\n",

      "The increased resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin and its partner drugs poses a serious challenge to global malaria control and elimination programs. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Mesua ferrea Linn., a medicinal plant, as a source for novel antimalarial compounds. In this study, we conducted in vitro assays to evaluate the antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity of crude extracts derived from M. ferrea L. leaves and branches. Subsequently, the most promising extracts were subjected to assessments of their antimalarial efficacy and acute oral toxicity tests in mouse models. Furthermore, selected crude extracts underwent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify their phytochemical compositions. Our findings revealed that the ethanolic extract of M. ferrea L. branches (EMFB) exhibited high antimalarial activity, with an IC50 value of 4.54 μg/mL, closely followed by the ethanolic extract of M. ferrea L. leaves (EMFL), with an IC50 value of 6.76 μg/mL. Conversely, the aqueous extracts of M. ferrea L. branches (AMFB) and leaves (AMFL) exhibited weak and inactive activity, respectively. The selected extracts, EMFB and EMFL, demonstrated significant dose-dependent parasitemia suppression, reaching a maximum of 62.61% and 54.48% at 600 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, the acute oral toxicity test indicated no observable toxicity at a dosage of 2,000 mg/kg body weight for both extracts. GC-MS analysis revealed abundant compounds in the EMFB, such as oleamide, cis-β-farnesene, alloaromadendrene, physcion, palmitic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and 4H-pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-, while the EMFL contained friedelin, friedelinol, betulin, β-caryophyllene, oleamide, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural.

However, research on the most effective mode to address this issue is still limited. Our study evaluated the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in improving treatment adherence, completion, and treatment success among tuberculosis (TBC) patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by searching articles from six databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, Jstor, Embase, and Scopus from 2018 to April 2023. Two independent reviewers assessed the study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. We analysed the data using a random-effects model. We also conducted publication bias and sensitivity analysis. In total, 13 studies were identified and 4,794 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that technology-based interventions were effective in improving treatment adherence, completion, and success (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.57, 95% Confident Interval (CI): 1.01–6.50, I2 = 86.6%; OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 0.95–3.28, I2: 82.3%; OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 0.85–3.06, I2: 84%, respectively). We examined the possibility of publication bias in the published studies included in this systematic review. However, no evidence of publication bias was found. From the sensitivity analysis by removing one study randomly, we found that our results are robust. Based on the results, we can conclude that technology-based interventions like MERM, text-based messages, video conferencing, and VOT are effective in increasing treatment adherence and completion in tuberculosis management.

      "The quality of care given by EMS staff is in part monitored by routine review of deployment reports that the providers must complete after each deployment. The assessment consists of determining whether a deployment was performed in a medically correct manner and thus whether the clinical reasoning process was appropriate. The time used during the deployment is also measured, as there are often time limits for performing different parts of the deployment and these must be adhered to. One might question whether measuring the time spent really gives insight into the quality of care, and if it might not be more useful to see how that time was spent. We therefore conceived a study to map the EMS care process and evaluate this process in relation to the time used.\n",

By categorising the professional activities we identified we were able to define a model that describes in general the EMS care process. We reported the first part of this study in which we developed this so called SPART model in a separate paper. In this second part of the study we determined the execution time within a deployment and measured the frequency of occurrence and the duration of the identified activities. We interpreted the operational content and the time variables both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also determined the distribution of activities over the three deployment operational periods (response, on-scene and transport period).\n",

Generally, the studied cases were followable, and the clinical reasoning process was medically logical. The diagnostic process sometimes continued after the clinical decision, which was not medically logical. Remarkably, this never changed the clinical decision. Although this could negatively affect the quality of care, we found no clinical evidence that this was the case.\n",

Acetylation of microtubules greatly improves their stability, especially when subjected to cooling or drug treatment. Since kinetochore microtubules are acetylated in a variety of eukaryote cells, we wondered whether deacetylation of kinetochore microtubules was necessary in order for microtubules to be able to depolymerize during anaphase. HDAC6 (Histone Deacetylase 6) deacetylates acetylated tubulin. To study whether tubulin must be deacetylated during anaphase, we added to living cells two different HDAC6 inhibitors (Tubacin and Trichostatin A), separately, as chromosomes moved poleward in anaphase. Both HDAC6 inhibitors altered chromosome movement: chromosomes either completely stopped moving, or moved more slowly, or sometimes continued movement without speed changes. The effects of the inhibitors on chromosome movement are reversible: half-bivalents either restarted anaphase movement by themselves before washing out the inhibitor or resumed their poleward movement after the inhibitor was washed out. We suggest that kinetochore microtubules need to be deacetylated in order for normal anaphase movements to occur.\n",

      "The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged both the scientific community and government authorities in Colombia. Both sectors are collaborating to understand the transmission and spread of the virus and to establish control strategies. This study proposes a biomathematical model with difference equations to analyze the transmission of Covid-19 in Santiago de Cali from March 2020 to June 2022. The results indicate that most of the inhabitants could be positive at some point, but with containment measures, a manageable number of symptomatic cases could be maintained. In addition, the cumulative fatality curve is fitted to the Gompertz model. The method used for parameter fitting or estimation was Gauss-Newton. This approach provides valuable information for decision making and pandemic management in the city.\n",

      "Human papillomavirus (HPV), which is transmitted through sexual activity, is the primary cause of cervical cancer and the fourth most common type of cancer in women. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was employed to predict immunodominant epitopes from a diverse array of antigens with the ultimate objective of designing a potent multiepitope vaccine against multiple HPV types. Immunodominant B cell, cytotoxic T cell (CTL), and helper T cell (HTL) epitopes were predicted using bioinformatics tools These epitopes were subsequently analyzed using various immunoinformatics tools, and those that exhibited high antigenicity, immunogenicity, non-allergenicity, non-toxicity, and excellent conservation were selected. The selected epitopes were linked with appropriate linkers and adjuvants to formulate a broad-spectrum multiepitope vaccine candidate against HPV. The stability of the multiepitope vaccine candidate was confirmed through structural analysis, and docking results indicated a high affinity for Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated a persistent interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with the multiepitope vaccine candidate. In silico immunological simulations showed that three injections of the multiepitope vaccine candidate resulted in high levels of B- and T-cell immune responses. Moreover, the in silico cloning results indicated that the multiepitope vaccine candidate could be expressed in substantial amounts in E. coli. The results of this study imply that designing a broad-spectrum vaccine against various HPV types using computational methods is plausible; however, experimental validation and safety testing to confirm the findings is essential.\n",

      "The classification codes granted by patent offices are useful instruments for simplifying the bewildering variety of patents in existence. They are singularly unhelpful, however, in locating a specific subgroup of patents such as that of drug-related pharmaceutical patents for which no classification codes exist. Taking advantage of advances in artificial intelligence and in natural language processing in particular, we offer a new method of identifying chemical drug-related patents in this article. The aim is primarily that of demonstrating how the proverbial needle in a haystack was identified, namely through leveraging the superb pattern-recognition abilities of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) algorithm. We build three different databases to train our algorithm and fine-tune its abilities to identify the patent group in question by exposing it to additional texts containing structures that are much more likely to be present in them, until we obtain the highest possible F1-score, combined with an accuracy of 94.40%. We also demonstrate some possible uses of the algorithm. Its application to the US patent office database enables the identification of potential chemical drug patents up to ten years before drug approval, whereas its application to the German patent office reveals the regional nature of drug R&D and patenting strategies. The hope is that both the method proposed and its applications will be further refined and expanded forthwith.\n",

      "Neuroprotective drugs as adjunctive therapy for adults with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains contentious. This study summarizes the latest evidence regarding the benefits of neuroprotective agents combined with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) intravenous thrombolysis. This study conducted a structured search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Wanfang Data, and CNKI databases from their inception to March 2024. Grey literature was also searched. The outcomes included efficacy (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and Barthel Index (BI) score) and safety (rate of adverse reactions). A total of 70 randomized controlled trials were selected for this network meta-analysis (NMA), encompassing 4,140 patients with AIS treated using different neuroprotective agents plus RT-PA, while 4,012 patients with AIS were in control groups. The top three treatments for NIHSS scores at the 2-week follow-up were Edaravone Dexborneo with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA, Edaravone with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA, and HUK with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA. HUK with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA, Dl-3n-butylphthalide with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA, and Edaravone Dexborneo with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA were ranked the top three for BI scores at the 2-week follow-up. The top three treatments with the lowest adverse effect rates were 0.6 mg/kg rt-PA, HUK with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA, and Edaravone Dexborneo with 0.9 mg/kg rt-PA due to their excellent safety profiles. Compared to rt-PA alone, the combination treatments of Edaravone+rt-PA, Edaravone Dexborneol+rt-PA, HUK+rt-PA, Dl-3n-butylphthalide+rt-PA, and Ganglioside GM1+rt-PA have shown superior efficacy. This NMA suggest that combination therapies of neuroprotective agents and rt-PA can offer better outcomes for patients with AIS. The results support the potential integration of these combination therapies into standard AIS treatment, aiming for improved patient outcomes and personalized therapeutic approaches.\n",

      "Lower limb lymphedema (LLL) is a common postoperative complication following lymphadenectomy in cervical and endometrial cancers. Removal of the circumflex iliac nodes distal to the external iliac node (CINDEIN) is associated with LLL. Here, we sought to evaluate whether preserving the CINDEIN is helpful in reducing the incidence of LLL in women with cervical and endometrial cancers and to evaluate the safety of preserving CINDEIN. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients with clinical stage I A2 to II A cervical cancer and stage I to III endometrial carcinoma undergoing surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo pelvic lymphadenectomy with CINDEIN removal or preservation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of LLL at 24 months post-surgery. Eligible patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with carbon nanoparticles (CNP). The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number ChiCTR2300071911. Between Jun 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2018, 328 participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. Thirteen patients were excluded from the lymphedema analysis. A total of 158 patients in the CINDEIN preservation group and 157 in the CINDEIN removal group completed the follow-up examination. At baseline, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The 3-year overall survival rate was 96.9% in the preservation group and 95.7% in the resection group. For cervical cancer and endometrial carcinoma, the incidence of LLL were significantly lower in the preservation group than in the removal group both at 24 months. No differences in the occurrence time of LLL were observed between the two groups. The LLL stages also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In the removal group, no CINDEIN metastases were identified in any patient. A total of 125 evaluable patients received the injection of CNP. None of the patients had CINDEIN detected as SLNs. CINDEIN removal is an important risk factor for LLL following lymphadenectomy in cervical and endometrial cancers. The metastasis rate of CINDEIN in cervical cancer and early endometrial cancer is relatively low, and preserving CINDEIN might be safe and helpful in reducing the occurrence of LLL.\n",

      "Dams provide water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic use, particularly in arid regions. However, controlled dam releases due to heavy rainfall may affect downstream communities’ livelihoods and life courses such long-term impacts may be omitted from damage and loss assessments. This study aims to assess the lived experiences and long-term consequences of dam release flooding for downstream populations, comparing these with the typical scope of a damage and loss assessment (DaLA).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "This research was conducted in two flood-prone districts in the White Volta basin, Ghana, subject to dam spillage. Four Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with community opinion headers, household heads, chiefs, local politicians, and institutional staff were conducted and analysed, alongside semi-structured interviews with twelve opinion leaders and disaster-related institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Flood-affected communities struggled to attract partners for marriage due to stigmatisation from flooding impacts. Women outside flooded areas rejected male members’ marriage proposals, while communities offered young girls for marriage to wealthy men for greater financial security. Out-migration of female members to seek better livelihoods frequently led to divorce, subsequently affecting children’s education and well-being. Participants reported long-term trauma from flood-related contact with dangerous wildlife, travel disruption, disease risk, livelihood loss, and accidents. Such life course events and long-term trauma would be omitted from a DaLA exercise.\n",

      "The advent of blockchain technology within the healthcare domain has signified a paradigm shift, transitioning from an emerging trend to an essential infrastructure component that ensures decentralization, transparency, integrity, and persistent availability. Despite its potential, the healthcare sector has not fully capitalized on the vast array of benefits blockchain technology offers. Most existing works utilized blockchain technology within a specific healthcare entity’s services but not among several healthcare organizations. They notably lack the provision for direct communication and knowledge transfer between doctors from different hospitals. Therefore, this paper introduces a pioneering Blockchain-based Unified Medical Consultancy Service (B-UMCS) that leverages blockchain’s robustness to revolutionize telehealth services by (a) alleviating the shortage of medical expertise through facilitating the interconnection of physicians from diverse hospitals and geographical areas onto a consolidated platform, (b) promoting the seamless sharing of medical consultations, electronic health records (EHRs), and expert insights while upholding rigorous security and privacy protocols, (c) integrating the inherent security mechanisms of blockchain with the distributed data storage functionality offered by the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). This work details the B-UMCS’s components, interactions, smart contracts, protocols, algorithms, storage and transmission of EHRs, and their corresponding implementations. The evaluations of the proposed B-UMCS reveal that it secures and facilitates the sharing of EHRs and enables healthcare professionals to collaborate and exchange expertise seamlessly across institutional boundaries. They are additionally ensuring that healthcare providers can offer their knowledge in an efficient and scalable manner. Overall, B-UMCS not only addresses the current challenges in healthcare data security and accessibility but also opens new avenues for collaboration and knowledge sharing among healthcare professionals, ultimately contributing to improving patient care quality.\n",

      "Osteological data, such as biological sex, constitute a base for research in paleodemography and palaeopathology, as well as for understanding past socio-cultural practices. Despite extensive research efforts concerning cremated human remains over the past decades, an internationally acknowledged, standardized osteological protocol is not fully agreed upon. Furthermore, assessing cremation research practices from the literature is challenging because analysis reports are often written in the national languages of practitioners, which makes them difficult to access by an international audience. This study addresses this gap by directly reaching out to experts working with cremated human remains through an online questionnaire in Lime Survey. The aim is to identify and characterize patterns in cremation analysis practices. A particular emphasis was put on the methods of biological sex estimation. While the significance of these data is widely acknowledged, the ways in which they are obtained in practice are seldom examined. The results of this survey reveal an absence of standardization in protocols of analysis, and data collection, as well as in reporting on the cremated remains in publications and reports. Notably, the findings reveal regional preferences in methodological choices and inconsistent institutional training. A majority of respondents expressed a preference for traditional morphological methods over recently published metric and alternative methods for sex estimation. These variations underscore the complexity of establishing standardized cremation analysis protocols and highlight the importance of considering regional contexts and training in shaping future research practices.\n",

      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an increasingly recognized role in modulating cancer development. Due to their function in regulating gene expression, miRNAs can suppress or promote tumorigenesis. miR-379-5p expression is downregulated in multiple human cancers, including breast and bladder cancers. However, the mRNAs targeted by miR-379-5p that promote cancer development have not been fully identified. Our goal was to identify a gene whose expression is regulated by miR-379-5p, and which may contribute to cancer development in cells where miR-379-5p expression is reduced. Bioinformatics analysis showed the UBE2E3 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene to be a potential target for miR-379-5p. To verify that UBE2E3 is a target, we transfected normal human epithelial mammary cells and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines with a miR-379-5p mimic. The mimic reduced UBE2E3 mRNA and protein levels, as would be predicted for a miR-379-5p target. To determine if UBE2E3 is a direct target of miR-379-5p, we engineered two luciferase reporter gene constructs to contain either a wild-type putative miR-379-5p binding sequence isolated from the 3’UTR of the UBE2E3 gene, or a scrambled sequence. The luciferase assay showed that the miR-379-5p mimic suppressed luciferase activity for the WT binding sequence reporter, but not for the scrambled reporter, showing that the effect of miR-379-5p on UBE2E3 expression is likely to be direct. Finally, to determine if the effect of miR-379-5p on UBE2E3 is related to cellular behaviors that play a role in cancer development, we measured cell viability by resazurin assay, cell proliferation by BrdU assay, and apoptosis by caspase 3/7 activation assay. The miR-379-5p mimic and silencing UBE2E3 expression both resulted in significantly diminished cell viability, while silencing UBE2E3 demonstrated both higher proliferation and apoptotic rates. Overall, these results suggest that while the overall effect of miR-379-5p is to inhibit breast cell viability and proliferation, the effect of silencing its target UBE2E3 is more complex because it induces both cell proliferation and apoptosis.\n",

      "Peripheral glia are important regulators of diverse physiologic functions yet their molecular distinctions and locations in almost all visceral organs are not well-understood. We performed a systematic analysis of peripheral glia, focusing on the lung and leveraging single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize their cellular and molecular features. Using in vivo lineage studies, we characterized the anatomic, cellular, and molecular features of the Sox10+ glial lineage of the mouse lung. Using high-resolution imaging, we quantified the distribution and cellular morphologies of myelinating, non-myelinating, satellite, and terminal glial cells with their intricate extensions along peripheral nerves, including terminals at specialized neurosensory structures within the lung. Spatial analysis of selectively expressed myelinating (periaxin/Prx, claudin 19/Cldn) or non-myelinating (sodium channel/Scn7a) glial cell genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis revealed molecularly distinct populations surrounding myelinated nerve fibers in the lung. To extend this analysis to primates and other organs, we extracted rare peripheral glial cells in whole organism scRNA-seq atlases of mouse lemur and human. Our cross-species data analysis and integration of scRNA-seq data of ~700 peripheral glial cells from mouse, mouse lemur, and human glial cells identified conserved gene expression of molecularly distinct peripheral glial cell populations. This foundational knowledge facilitates subsequent functional studies targeting molecularly distinct subsets of peripheral glia and integrating them into organ-specific disorders of autonomic dysregulation. In addition, our cross-species analysis identifying conserved gene expression patterns and glial networks in extrapulmonary organs provides a valuable resource for studying the functional role of peripheral glia in multiorgan human diseases.\n",

      "V-ATPase Subunit G1 (ATP6V1G1) is one of the subunits of Vacuolar ATPases. Previous studies have indicated that ATP6V1G1 plays important roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with HCC progression. However, the effect of ATP6V1G1 in HCC requires further elucidation. The aim of the present study was to explore the roles of ATP6V1G1 in HCC and further decipher the detailed mechanism. To identify the phosphorylated proteins regulated by ATP6V1G1 in HCC, phosphoproteomics and LC-MS/MS analysis were performed on HepG2 with overexpression of ATP6V1G1 and empty vector. Western blotting was applied to validate the differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DEPPs). As a result, 163 DEPPs were identified by proteomics; two up-regulated phosphorylated proteins (p-RPS6(Ser235)) and (p-SQSTM1(Ser272)) and two down-regulated phosphorylated proteins (p-PDPK1(Ser241)) and (p-EEF2 (Ser57)) were validated. Taken together, this study highlighted the potential impact of ATP6V1G1 on tumor progression, which may be beneficial to liver cancer related basic research.\n",

      "Alcohol consumption has been a central practice in Sabah, Malaysia. However, this region has witnessed a nuanced shift in drinking habits over the last decade, raising concerns about the health, economic, and social implications of alcohol use within the community in Sabah. This study explores the impact of gender narratives and cultural transformations on alcohol consumption within Sabah over the last decade. The objectives of this research include 1) assessing the shifts in alcohol consumption patterns over the last 10 years, 2) understand the role of gender differences in shaping these patterns, and 3) identify the economic consequences resulting from the changes. Employing a qualitative approach, we conducted focus group interviews with members of the native community, each group consisting of up to 7 participants. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes pertaining to gender roles, cultural practices, and socioeconomic influences of alcohol consumption. The data were then contextualized using Bronfenbrenner’s social-ecological model and social role theory. The study reveals a significant shift in drinking habits. Historically, alcohol was mostly consumed by men, but now more women are drinking, changing long-standing gender roles related to alcohol use. Children often copy their parents’ drinking behaviors, and with alcohol being more easily available, more people are drinking than before. Our findings also expose the complex consequences of alcohol use, which extend to health concerns, familial tension, and economic hardship. Despite the entrenched cultural status of alcohol, these negative outcomes are exacerbated by a lack of supportive healthcare services. In light of these insights, the study suggests the need for intervention plans that respect the cultural background of Sabah and account for gender dynamics while tackling the current issues of alcohol misuse. The research adds to the wider conversation about managing alcohol in different cultural settings and also recommended strategies based on the findings, such as cultural and gender sensitive community programs, youth centered programs, community-based healthcare services, employment support and training and development of laws and policies.\n",

This research explores whether individual differences in various dimensions of religiosity are associated with interoceptive sensibility (IS), i.e., one’s perceived ability to detect and interpret bodily signals. In Study 1, Christians, Muslims, and Hindus (N = 1570) reported their religiosity and completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, a well-validated measure of IS. Results show that religious identity moderates the relationship between the centrality of religion in one’s life and IS such that the association is positive and medium for Christians, large for Muslims and Hindus. In addition, the medium positive correlation between frequency of religious practice and IS was similar across religious groups. Study 2 (N = 450) extended these results by measuring additional dimensions of religiosity and spirituality as well as investigating religious-related beliefs about the body, both positive (e.g., My body is holy) and negative (e.g., My body is sinful). Associations between religiosity and IS are replicated and found for spirituality as well. Interestingly, mediation analyses reveal that belief in the body as holy partially explains the association between religiosity and IS, but belief in the body as sinful suppresses such association. We discuss how religion, as a cultural factor, may influence beliefs about the body and bodily awareness, with implications for emotion regulation and mental health.\n",

      "Two major welfare problems in laying hen farming are keel bone damage (KBD) and cannibalism. Their assessment is time-consuming, needs well-trained assessors, and prevalence estimates are often imprecise due to small sample sizes. Here, the bottleneck slaughterhouse comes into focus where large numbers of animals can be inspected. However, this is only an option if the prevalences recorded at the slaughterhouse reasonably agree with on-farm assessments. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of KBD and skin injuries in 20 commercial laying hen flocks (i) before depopulation on-farm (ii) after transport and lairage time at arrival at the slaughterhouse, and (iii) at the slaughter line. Bland-Altman plots and equivalence tests were conducted. In addition, the consistency of welfare evaluations of the results according to a traffic light scheme was investigated. Cloacal injuries could not technically be recorded on the slaughter line. With an arbitrary precision of ± 2% for dorsal skin injuries and ± 5% for KBD, the results from farm and slaughter line did not reach equivalence. For dorsal skin injuries, the detected mean prevalence across all flocks examined increased numerically from the farm (15.1%) to the slaughter line (22.8%). In addition, the traffic light evaluations changed between farm and slaughter line in 80% of cases in different directions. Therefore, it cannot be recommended to derive evaluations of on-farm welfare from assessments of skin injuries at the slaughter line. In contrast, the mean detected prevalence of KBD across all flocks decreased consistently (r = 0.794) from the farm (56.0%) to the slaughter line (41.7%). It can be concluded that the assessment of KBD at the slaughter line consistently underestimates KBD prevalences compared to on-farm assessments, but this can be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. Slaughter line assessment of KBD may be a feasible option for monitoring severe welfare problems due to KBD in commercial practice.\n",

      "Micronutrients such as vitamins are transferred from lower to higher trophic levels, but no general ecological concept describes the factors regulating this process. Here, we investigated thiamin (thiamine, vitamin B1), which is an example of a metabolically important water-soluble micronutrient. Thiamin is produced by organisms such as bacteria and phytoplankton, and all consumers, such as zooplankton and fish, rely on a continuous intake of thiamin through their diet and possibly from de novo-synthesized thiamin by gut microbiota. A deficiency in thiamin negatively affects reproduction in fish and bird populations worldwide. The aim of this study was to quantify thiamin transfer in a planktonic food web in response to thiamin and/or nutrient addition, using an outdoor mesocosm system (an approximately 1.9 m3 bag submerged in sea water). These estimates were then compared with literature data on thiamin concentrations at different trophic levels. The results showed that thiamin was rapidly taken up by phytoplankton in both the ambient and nutrient-amended treatments. However, large differences in thiamin concentrations in phytoplankton did not lead to any significant changes in community composition or abundance. Nitrogen addition led to changes in the abundance and community composition of picoplankton and phytoplankton but there were no additional major effects of thiamin addition. Differences in thiamin concentrations in phytoplankton were not detected at the next trophic level in zooplankton. Although the concentrations did not change, a greater abundance of some zooplankton taxa were developed in the thiamin treatments. Comparing the mesocosm results with literature data demonstrated a gradual reduction in thiamin concentrations along the food chain, with six percent of the concentration in producers occurring in top consumers (i.e., piscivorous fish). Overall, these observations illustrate the concept of trophic dilution of micronutrients where concentrations decrease along the food web from phytoplankton via zooplankton and planktivorous fish to piscivorous fish.\n",

      "We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of aerobic, resistance and/or combined training on flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and/or pulse wave velocity (PWV) in older adults. The studies were selected from the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane, LILACS, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the gray literature. We assessed the studies using Cochrane risk of bias (RoB2) tool and the GRADE tool. The GRADE assessment showed moderate quality of evidence for aerobic training and resistance training and very low for combined training. The measures of effects are presented as mean differences of the intervention group versus the control group and related 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) pooled by a random-effects model using an inverse variance method. Our analysis of 24 RCTs (Intervention group [n = 251]: 67.7 ± 5.6 years old; control group [n = 228]: 68.7 ± 5.9 years old) showed that aerobic training was effective to improve FMD (0.64% [95% CI 0.24 to 1.03], p = 0.002) and PWV (–1.21 m/s [95% CI –1.37 to –1.05], p< 0.001) by compared to the control group. The subgroup analyses showed no FMD differences following aerobic training in healthy adults when compared to those with any health condition. Combined training was effective in improving FMD (0.60% [95% CI 0.50 to 0.71], p< 0.001) and PWV (-0.79 m/s [95% CI –1.23 to –0.35], p = 0.002). But these same parameters did not show any improvement in response to resistance training. A major limitation of this study is that the analysis to evaluate the effect of resistance training on PWV include only one study, and no inferences could be made from the data. Aerobic and combined training, but not resistant training, improve flow-mediated dilation and pulse wave velocity in the elderly. PROSPERO: CRD42021275282.\n",

      "In the current era, a lot of research is being done in the domain of disease diagnosis using machine learning. In recent times, one of the deadliest respiratory diseases, COVID-19, which causes serious damage to the lungs has claimed a lot of lives globally. Machine learning-based systems can assist clinicians in the early diagnosis of the disease, which can reduce the deadly effects of the disease. For the successful deployment of these machine learning-based systems, hyperparameter-based optimization and feature selection are important issues. Motivated by the above, in this proposal, we design an improved model to predict the existence of respiratory disease among patients by incorporating hyperparameter optimization and feature selection. To optimize the parameters of the machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter optimization with a genetic algorithm is proposed and to reduce the size of the feature set, feature selection is performed using binary grey wolf optimization algorithm. Moreover, to enhance the efficacy of the predictions made by hyperparameter-optimized machine learning models, an ensemble model is proposed using a stacking classifier. Also, explainable AI was incorporated to define the feature importance by making use of Shapely adaptive explanations (SHAP) values. For the experimentation, the publicly accessible Mexico clinical dataset of COVID-19 was used. The results obtained show that the proposed model has superior prediction accuracy in comparison to its counterparts. Moreover, among all the hyperparameter-optimized algorithms, adaboost algorithm outperformed all the other hyperparameter-optimized algorithms. The various performance assessment metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, were used to assess the results.\n",

      "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), an incurable motor neuron disease, primarily affects those between the ages of 60–79, and has an approximate post-diagnosis life-expectancy of only two to five years. The condition has an unpredictable but ultimately terminal trajectory that poses challenges for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. While the diagnosis and disclosure are critical periods for intervention and support, knowledge regarding the relational, communicational and psychodynamic forces that occur within the process of diagnostic disclosure is relatively limited.\n",

      "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic alerted the potential for significant harm due to future cross-species transmission of various animal coronaviruses to human. There is a significant need of antibody-based drugs to treat patients infected with previously unseen coronaviruses. In this study, we generated CV804, an antibody that binds to the S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is highly conserved across the coronavirus family and less susceptible to mutations. CV804 demonstrated broad cross-reactivities not only disease-associated human beta coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and with existing mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 and but also with 20 representative animal-origin coronaviruses. CV804 exhibits strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed on cells in vitro, while completely lacks virus-neutralization activity. In animal models, CV804 suppressed disease progression caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Structural studies using HDX-MS combined with reactivity analysis with point mutants of recombinant spike proteins revealed that CV804 binds to a unique conformational epitope within the S2 domain of the spike proteins that is highly conserved among various coronaviruses. Overall, obtained data suggest that the non-neutralizing CV804 antibody recognizes the conformational structure of the spike protein displayed on the surface of infected cells and weakens the viral virulence by supporting the host immune cells’ attack through ADCC activity in vivo. The CV804 epitope information revealed in this study is useful for designing pan-corona antibody therapeutics and universal coronavirus vaccines for preparing potential future pandemics.\n",

      "The demand for evidence syntheses to inform urgent decision-making surged during the pandemic. The challenging circumstances of the pandemic created significant hurdles for both those requesting and creating evidence syntheses, leading to the refinement and adjustment of evidence synthesis practices. This research sought to capture and explore how the field of evidence synthesis evolved and adapted during the pandemic from the perspective of those who produced evidence syntheses in Canada. In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were carried out between October 2022 to January 2023. Twenty-two participants from 19 different organizations across seven provinces and one territory were interviewed. This included producers of evidence syntheses from academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, and provincial and federal government. Data analysis was conducted thematically using a phenomenological approach. Results indicated the evidence synthesis landscape drastically changed during the pandemic including short timelines to produce syntheses and changes in the volume, types, and quality of literature included in them. Due to the changing landscape and different needs of requestors, evidence synthesis methodologies evolved, synthesis products were tailored, and quality assessment tools were adapted. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence, processes for engaging subject matter experts and patient-citizen partners, and the coordination of the evidence synthesis community changed. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding evidence synthesis to inform decision-making, and highlights the importance of flexibility and necessity of continuously evolving methodologies to meet the demands of frequently changing landscapes. The lessons learned from this study can help inform future strategies for improving evidence synthesis practices not only in the face of public health emergencies, but also in everyday practice.\n",

      "Hand motion intention recognition has been considered as one of the crucial research fields for prosthetic control and rehabilitation medicine. In recent years, surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals that directly reflect human motion information are ideal input sources for prosthetic control and rehabilitation. However, how to effectively extract components from sEMG signals containing abundant limb movement information to improve the accuracy of hand recognition still is a difficult problem. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel hand motion recognition method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and ReliefF. First, VMD is used to decompose the sEMG signal into multiple variational mode functions (VMFs). To efficiently extract the intrinsic components of the sEMG, the recognition performance of different numbers of VMFs is evaluated. Then, four features representing hand motion intentions are extracted from the VMFs to form the initial feature space. Next, the ReliefF algorithm is used to remove redundant features from the feature space. In order to select a feature space that can effectively reflect the intention of hand movements, the hand movement recognition performance of 8 low-dimensional feature spaces is evaluated. Finally, three machine learning methods are used to recognize hand movements. The proposed method was tested on the sEMG for Basic Hand movements Data Set and achieved an average accuracy of 99.14%. Compared with existing research, the proposed method achieves better hand motion recognition performance, indicating the potential for healthcare and rehabilitation applications.\n",

      "College and university students often exhibit insufficient levels of physical activity, which negatively impacts their health, mental well-being, and academic performance. Social capital has emerged as a potential factor in promoting physical activity. This systematic review, conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines, examines the existing literature on the role of social capital in enhancing physical activity among college and university students. A search of the Web of Science, Scopus, SportDiscus, and PsychINFO databases identified 10 studies published by August 1, 2024, involving 2,700 students, primarily from North America and Europe. The overall quality of the included studies was high, with all scoring above 85% on quality assessments. The findings indicate that social capital, particularly strong social networks, support from family and friends, and high levels of social cohesion, is significantly associated with higher levels of physical activity among college and university students. Social capital may facilitate physical activity in group settings through mechanisms such as emotional support, role modeling, and social norms. Despite limitations within the existing research evidence, such as reliance on self-reported data and cross-sectional study designs, this review suggests that social capital holds potential for promoting physical activity in this population. Future research should prioritize the use of objective measurement tools and longitudinal designs to more accurately assess the long-term effects of social capital and explore how these findings can inform effective interventions.\n",

      "The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simple unsafe behavior checklist to assess the extent of unsafe behavior among workers in an industrial setting. The checklist was developed using Focus Group Interview (FGI) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis methodology. Preliminary testing was conducted with an unspecified sample and the correlation between unsafe behavior and accident experience was validated. The analyzed and compared the correlation between the type of unsafe behavior and accident experience and demonstrated the suitability of the unsafe behavior checklist. A risk sensitivity and risk-taking checklist was employed to identify five types of unsafe behavior. This study concludes that the unsafe behavior checklist can be used to predict accident concerns among workers with high types of dangerous behavior. This can help improve unsafe behavior and reduce the frequency of incidents. Therefore, the “Unsafe behavior Checklist” developed in this study can be used as an early indicator of the extent to which workers are aware of dangers in industrial workplaces in order to prevent accidents.\n",

      "Type I Diabetes is an endocrine disorder that prevents the pancreas from regulating the blood glucose (BG) levels in a patient’s body. The ubiquitous Linear-Quadratic-Integral-Regulator (LQIR) is an optimal glycemic regulation strategy; however, it is not resilient enough to withstand measurement noise and meal disruptions. The Sliding-Mode-Controller (SMC) yields robust BG regulation effort at the expense of a discontinuous insulin infusion rate that perturbs the BG concentrations. Hence, the novel contribution of this article is the formulation of a hybridized LQIR-driven SMC strategy that retrieves the benefits of the aforesaid control schemes while avoiding their inherent problems. The proposed control approach is realized by linearly combining a glycemic LQIR law with an innovative sign function sliding mode reaching law that is driven by a customized LQIR-driven sliding surface. The hybridized control scheme generates optimal control decisions yielded by the LQIR while mimicking the robustness characteristic of SMC against bounded exogenous disturbances. Additionally, the SMC reaching law in the proposed control scheme is augmented with a nonlinear adaptation mechanism that flexibly modulates the control activity to effectively compensate for the external perturbations while minimizing the chattering content. The controller parameters are numerically optimized offline. The efficacy of the prescribed hybrid control law is analyzed via customized MATLAB simulations that normalize the patient’s BG level to 80 mg/dL, under measurement noise and meal disruptions, from an initial hyperglycemic state. The results justify the improved BG regulation accuracy and disturbance-rejection capability of the proposed control procedure.\n",

      "Social isolation affects physical functioning owing to psychological stress. We constructed a rat model to clarify the unexplored effects of social isolation and to determine whether environmental changes as an intervention against social isolation can reduce the stress-inducing effects of social isolation on physiological factors. Eight-week-old male rats were divided into three groups: group-housed, isolated, and intervention. Group-housed rats were kept 2 animals per cage. Isolated rats were kept 1 rat per cage. The intervention group alternated between the isolation and group-housed conditions. All rats were euthanized after 21 days. Their plasma, masseter muscles, and lower limb muscles were collected. Body weight, food intake, locomotor activity, muscle weight, and plasma corticosterone, ghrelin, and myostatin levels were measured. The results indicated that there were no significant differences between the group-housed and intervention groups for all outcomes. However, weight gain, food intake, and plasma corticosterone levels were higher in the isolated group than in the group-housed group. Plasma myostatin levels were higher in the isolated group than in the intervention group. Plasma ghrelin concentrations were lower in the isolated group than in the group-housed or intervention groups. In the isolated group, locomotor activity decreased compared to that in the intervention group. The lower limb muscle weight ratio also decreased in the isolated group compared to that in the group-housed and intervention groups. In conclusion, isolation decreased physical activity and affected body weight, food intake, and muscle weight; these changes were associated with corticosterone as a stress marker, ghrelin as an appetite-related factor, and myostatin, which is a growth inhibitor of skeletal muscles. Moreover, these changes were suppressed when the isolation time was reduced in the intervention group. The present study suggests that intermittent breaking of isolation may reduce the physical effects of isolation.\n",
